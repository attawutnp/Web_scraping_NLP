Ck101 wrote a review Jan 2020,50,Amazing hotel in Jomtien,"I cannot fault this hotel in any possible way and I'm a little fussy with small details.    Stayed for almost a month and all staff encountered including Stefan were very friendly and helpful.    One of the cheapest places to stay in Jomtien area and great location in soi 4 about a 2 minute walk to the beach and main road.    my room was very spacious, comfortable bed and I liked that it has both AC and fan option. Didn't opt for a balcony room as I hardly use a balcony but there was a table and 2 chairs in the room which was very adequate.    I didn't have breakfast during my time there because I prefer to sleep a few more hours in the morning so I can't comment on that but I'm sure it's up to excellent standards.    Thank you for the wonderful stay. Highly recommend your hotel to anyone. Next time I'm in the area I will only stay with you.","STEFAN'S GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897133,100.869827&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897133,100.869827|12.897133,100.869827&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.897036,100.868607|12.896251,100.869408|12.901025,100.869698|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.897312,100.871132|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118|12.897419,100.870224&signature=KlX6GI12vqKfSneZoxtyXui-5jY="

NOTEV wrote a review Jan 2016,30,Budget with quality,"This is a guest house in Jomtien/Pattaya that was a nice surprise. After deciding to stay another night in the area we just took a taxi to beach road in Jomtien and ended up at Stefan's. The room had a fairly new AC, but it did in fact lit up the room at night due to the LED light that sows it was on.    The rooms were clean and the receptionist could speak English very well. The resonnable room price included breakfast that was a selection of different country specialities like American, Belgic, French etc. It was in fact more expensive to have a few toasts with jam, than a full breakfast.    Unfortunately they were fully booket the next night so we had to move to another place after this. It was free WiFi but it has stability issues, so probably not suited for video calls or similar.","STEFAN'S GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897133,100.869827&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897133,100.869827|12.897133,100.869827&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.897036,100.868607|12.896251,100.869408|12.901025,100.869698|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.897312,100.871132|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118|12.897419,100.870224&signature=KlX6GI12vqKfSneZoxtyXui-5jY="

The Guest House itself, which is quite extensive, is not greatly up-market, yet is comfortable, clean, air conditioned, with WiFi, TV etc., and reasonable priced.

Raj wrote a review Jul 2015,40,Great guest-house with a friendly and warm staff..,"Stayed here with family for a day and had a good experience.  I booked this going by the great reviews and was apprehensive about this after my sad experience at a guest-house in Bangkok, however, it turned out to be really good.  Checkin/Reception:  There was some confusion regarding the online booking initially, however, the reception staff were friendly and helpful and the checkin was smooth.  Room:  The room was big, clean and comfortable. The staff arranged for an extra bed too, which was nice and welcoming. The bathroom was also big and nicely done. The room had a TV, a set of table/chairs, a refrigerator and everything worked fine.  The biggest plus of the place is the location, which is Soi 10, next to the Jomiten beach. Infact, the road of the hotel has many budget hotels which are of great value.  Food:  We had our lunch at the restaurant below and the breakfast next day. Both were good and value for money. The food was nice and the restaurant service was good too.  Massage:  My parents got the Thai massage service at the hotel at 200 THB, which was good and relaxing.    Overall a great place to stay and value for money for the location bang next to the beach.","STEFAN'S GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897133,100.869827&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897133,100.869827|12.897133,100.869827&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.897036,100.868607|12.896251,100.869408|12.901025,100.869698|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.897312,100.871132|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118|12.897419,100.870224&signature=KlX6GI12vqKfSneZoxtyXui-5jY="

ALLAN H wrote a review Sep 2014,40,"A Stay at Stefan's, Soi 4 Jomtien","We have stayed at Stefan's Guest House many times, the last time being June 2014, because it is great value for money, clean and with friendly and helpful staff. It is conveniently located for the beach/bars/shops of Jomtien. The rooms are simple but very comfortable and you have a choice of basic but good food for breakfast. Sometimes it is buffet and sometimes a la carte, depends on how busy it is. The restaurant also does snacks and evening meals which are good also. We go to play golf and the last time Stefan's arranged the golf and transport for us and the arrangements worked very well, so we will be requesting the same next time. Booking requests are dealt with promptly and efficiently and we have never had a problem, but always try to give as much notice as possible to make sure you can get in. We have used the massage services provided as well as pedicure/manicure in the beauty salon and these have always been very good. Wifi is available and internet service is free to guests. We are always very happy to go back knowing we will be well looked after. Regarding the questions asked as part of this report, it has to be remembered this is a guest house, not a hotel, so the ratings have been given with this in mind.","STEFAN'S GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897133,100.869827&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897133,100.869827|12.897133,100.869827&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.897036,100.868607|12.896251,100.869408|12.901025,100.869698|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.897312,100.871132|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118|12.897419,100.870224&signature=KlX6GI12vqKfSneZoxtyXui-5jY="

LoZAngSilaThailand wrote a review Sep 2013,40,A good Place to stay in Jomtien.,"Firstly, after reading one of the reviews I really do wonder what some people expect in a guest house, it's not a ***** hotel, for the price of 500/600bht a night!    I've tried other places in this area but I decided Stefans is the place for me.    I always look at the room/sheets/bathroom in any hotel in Thailand before I accept them.    I've stayed here four times now and have not had any problems with the staff, they were all very helpful. Even though last time I'd forgotten to take my passport with me, they readily accepted my driving licence as ID.    The rooms were clean as were the sheets. The shower/toilet was clean, soap, towel etc. The water in the fridge still had the seals on.    We didn't eat here so I can't say what the food is like. Nor did I use the massage shop.    Situated in a quiet soi (4), a couple of bars across the road but no noise at night, our rooms were at the front facing the bars. There are many more bars in the next soi's up beach road (5/7/8/ soi White House)    Just a few minutes stroll to the beach, shops and café's along beach road.    Will definitely stay here again next time.","STEFAN'S GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897133,100.869827&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897133,100.869827|12.897133,100.869827&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.897036,100.868607|12.896251,100.869408|12.901025,100.869698|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.897312,100.871132|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118|12.897419,100.870224&signature=KlX6GI12vqKfSneZoxtyXui-5jY="

Accedos wrote a review Feb 2013,10,Appalling experience,"I have stayed in this place for one night. I will let you be the judge by describing my experience.  First of all, we spent 20 mintutes at the counter while the staff were teaching each other how to scan my passport (!) and issue a room key. To place you more into the atmosphere there are no air-cons or fans, just humidity. Secondly, after coming into the room I checked the bed sheets and they were all with BROWN (!) stains and some stains even from blue pens (?). The bathroom inspection showed that the ear buds bag was teared (!) and one was missing! To top things off, the bottled water in the refrigirator was missing a plastic security seal (!) and opened straight away- they were USED and RE-FILLED(!). In Thailand, water being so cheap and available in every single shop, this is an indiator that something is not right and it is probably tap water (your best bet). From the two available water bottles, they were both different types (!), both of which I never even heard of in my life (I have lived here for a long time).  And finally, in the morning staff started budging and knocking at our door at 12:20. Yes the check out time is 12:00, but after telling them we were on our way down they knocked again at 12:25 (!) with angry voices like we were some kind of intruders.  Downstairs, the owner, probably Stefan himself, with his wife and her bad english next to him, one by one,started lecturing on how he had customers waiting and how undispicable it was that we were not on time, and even insulted us by asking were we were from. I told him that most hotels give a 1 hour time frame to take care of guests who are a bit late with the check out to accomodate guest and got this reply- where did you hear this? Well my dear Stefan, I have been to over 50 countries and not a single hotel has given itself the scandalous and awful service as this one.

Chris H wrote a review Oct 2012,40,"affordable, good location and clean","Booked in for a few days and stayed longer. The room rate is reduced the longer you stay so if you think you will be there longer then say so.  Was shown two rooms, picked the larger one obviously. All very clean with all the usual facilities, en suite, tv, a/c and fridge. Safe tucked away in the wardrobe too.  Ate downstairs on a few occasions, both thai and western food, all good.  Friendly staff, always helpful with information or directions or getting the laundry done etc.  Quiet location on Soi 4 off the beach road, there are a couple of bars opposite that can be a bit noisy early in the evening but from my room at the rear I could not hear them, maybe if you have a balcony room it would be different. Short walk to the beach and everything else you need, bars, shops and restaurants.  10 minutes from Pattaya on the sawngthaew which will cost 10baht.  All in all a decent place to stay, would recommend.","STEFAN'S GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897133,100.869827&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897133,100.869827|12.897133,100.869827&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.897036,100.868607|12.896251,100.869408|12.901025,100.869698|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.897312,100.871132|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118|12.897419,100.870224&signature=KlX6GI12vqKfSneZoxtyXui-5jY="

Free internet but beware - you will get bitten by mosquitos while using their terminals.
