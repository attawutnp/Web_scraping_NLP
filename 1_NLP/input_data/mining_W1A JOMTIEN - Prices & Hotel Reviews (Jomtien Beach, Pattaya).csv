wonderrrring wrote a review Apr 2020,20,They cancelled my booking an hour before my check-in...,Booked a room for 7 nights. As I was on my way from my previous hotel to this hotel I received a missed call an hour prior to check-in time. No voicemail or emails. After arriving at the new hotel the whole hotel was locked down and no staff present. The hotel has been closed for several days but they didn't bother to make sure they weren't no longer listed online.

Brian Charles wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Unfortunate,"I liked this guesthouse. They do everything right down to the decor, staff friendliness and even the small rooms are well designed and laid out to maximize comfort. Unfortunately for me, it was in an area that was less than desirable and I found parking tough. I ended up not staying the night as I had an important meeting the next day and I could only imagine the raucous night ahead. Maybe just my imagination and under another circumstance, I would give it a chance. Staff went out of their way to make sure nothing was wrong on their end. I assured them it was just a personal choice and not their fault.

Maher T wrote a review Jan 2019,40,"Comfortable, well designed","As mentioned by previous guests the place looks fantastic, has good and quiet AC and has amazing staff but it has two disadvantages;  1) The drains smell....  2) The doors to the bathroom in all rooms squeak like anything. I suppose it is a fault in the doors because I never heard such loud squeaking anywhere and I have been to hundreds of hotels in my life.  In any case at the price and considering the area is quieter than most in Pattaya this is still a good deal. Just ask to be as far as possible from rooms with Chinese guests because they live up to their reputation of being very noisy.","W1A JOMTIEN - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.887975,100.881264&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.887975,100.881264&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.891585,100.874062|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.890499,100.879494|12.893726,100.876503|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.892040,100.873306|12.885211,100.881126|12.894398,100.874542&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950|12.884031,100.883522&signature=ac5JLxpOUcBRQ3ig6zqgrgPIBN0="

Lottie H wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Highly reccomend to anyone staying in pattaya,"W1A    A real hidden gem in a brilliant location. Didn't have many reviews so we took a gamble, but all paid off.    The staff were beyond helpful, but also made us feel incredibly comfortable and at home.    The hotel decor is minimalistic with concrete floors and funky bright furniture, it looks bright quirky and vibrant.    There is a shared kitchen in the lobby, you can help yourself to biscuits, hot drinks and noodles all complementary.    The rooms are basic but still go with the theme of the rest of the building and are absolutely IMMACULATE.    We came back to a fresh bed and towels every day, clean bathroom and even sometimes our clothes folded neatly on the bed (that we'd lazy thrown next to our bed in a hurry to get ready.. sorry). The cleaner was also extremely pleasant and smiley.    The hotel is about a 10 minute uber from central Pattaya but also has the beach 5 minute walk in a straight line down the road.    Do not be alarmed when you see the road it is on, there are a few noisy bars but also local shops, salon and laundrette and all of them are so pleasant as you walk by and ask how you are.    We enjoyed our stay so much we extended by 3 nights. Since leaving we've compared other hotels to our room and wished we was back there.    Well done to the staff, you do an amazing job and you should be really proud of what you have achieved. An honest, reliable and welcoming place to stay.","W1A JOMTIEN - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.887975,100.881264&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.887975,100.881264&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.891585,100.874062|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.890499,100.879494|12.893726,100.876503|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.892040,100.873306|12.885211,100.881126|12.894398,100.874542&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950|12.884031,100.883522&signature=ac5JLxpOUcBRQ3ig6zqgrgPIBN0="

Brian Charles wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Unfortunate,"I liked this guesthouse. They do everything right down to the decor, staff friendliness and even the small rooms are well designed and laid out to maximize comfort. Unfortunately for me, it was in an area that was less than desirable and I found parking tough. I ended up not staying the night as I had an important meeting the next day and I could only imagine the raucous night ahead.

Maher T wrote a review Jan 2019,40,"Comfortable, well designed","As mentioned by previous guests the place looks fantastic, has good and quiet AC and has amazing staff but it has two disadvantages;  1) The drains smell....  2) The doors to the bathroom in all rooms squeak like anything. I suppose it is a fault in the doors because I never heard such loud squeaking anywhere and I have been to hundreds of hotels in my life.  In any case at the price and considering the area is quieter than most in Pattaya this is still a good deal. Just ask to be as far as possible from rooms with Chinese guests because they live up to their reputation of being very noisy.","W1A JOMTIEN - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.887975,100.881264&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.887975,100.881264&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.891585,100.874062|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.890499,100.879494|12.893726,100.876503|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.892040,100.873306|12.885211,100.881126|12.894398,100.874542&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950|12.884031,100.883522&signature=ac5JLxpOUcBRQ3ig6zqgrgPIBN0="

The hotel decor is minimalistic with concrete floors and funky bright furniture, it looks bright quirky and vibrant.    There is a shared kitchen in the lobby, you can help yourself to biscuits, hot drinks and noodles all complementary.    The rooms are basic but still go with the theme of the rest of the building and are absolutely IMMACULATE.    We came back to a fresh bed and towels every day, clean bathroom and even sometimes our clothes folded neatly on the bed (that we'd lazy thrown next to our bed in a hurry to get ready.. sorry). The cleaner was also extremely pleasant and smiley.    The hotel is about a 10 minute uber from central Pattaya but also has the beach 5 minute walk in a straight line down the road.    Do not be alarmed when you see the road it is on, there are a few noisy bars but also local shops, salon and laundrette and all of them are so pleasant as you walk by and ask how you are.    We enjoyed our stay so much we extended by 3 nights. Since leaving we've compared other hotels to our room and wished we was back there.    Well done to the staff, you do an amazing job and you should be really proud of what you have achieved. An honest, reliable and welcoming place to stay.","W1A JOMTIEN - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.887975,100.881264&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.887975,100.881264&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.891585,100.874062|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.890499,100.879494|12.893726,100.876503|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.892040,100.873306|12.885211,100.881126|12.894398,100.874542&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950|12.884031,100.883522&signature=ac5JLxpOUcBRQ3ig6zqgrgPIBN0="

Brian Charles wrote a review Jun 2019,40,Unfortunate,"I liked this guesthouse. They do everything right down to the decor, staff friendliness and even the small rooms are well designed and laid out to maximize comfort. Unfortunately for me, it was in an area that was less than desirable and I found parking tough. I ended up not staying the night as I had an important meeting the next day and I could only imagine the raucous night ahead. Maybe just my imagination and under another circumstance, I would give it a chance. Staff went out of their way to make sure nothing was wrong on their end. I assured them it was just a personal choice and not their fault.

I suppose it is a fault in the doors because I never heard such loud squeaking anywhere and I have been to hundreds of hotels in my life.  In any case at the price and considering the area is quieter than most in Pattaya this is still a good deal.

Only complaint would be the room had a smell of drains which could be quite strong at times.","W1A JOMTIEN - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.887975,100.881264&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.887975,100.881264&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.891585,100.874062|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.890499,100.879494|12.893726,100.876503|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.892040,100.873306|12.885211,100.881126|12.894398,100.874542&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950|12.884031,100.883522&signature=ac5JLxpOUcBRQ3ig6zqgrgPIBN0="

Lottie H wrote a review Dec 2017,50,Highly reccomend to anyone staying in pattaya,"W1A    A real hidden gem in a brilliant location. Didn't have many reviews so we took a gamble, but all paid off.    The staff were beyond helpful, but also made us feel incredibly comfortable and at home.    The hotel decor is minimalistic with concrete floors and funky bright furniture, it looks bright quirky and vibrant.    There is a shared kitchen in the lobby, you can help yourself to biscuits, hot drinks and noodles all complementary.    The rooms are basic but still go with the theme of the rest of the building and are absolutely IMMACULATE.    We came back to a fresh bed and towels every day, clean bathroom and even sometimes our clothes folded neatly on the bed (that we'd lazy thrown next to our bed in a hurry to get ready.. sorry). The cleaner was also extremely pleasant and smiley.    The hotel is about a 10 minute uber from central Pattaya but also has the beach 5 minute walk in a straight line down the road.    Do not be alarmed when you see the road it is on, there are a few noisy bars but also local shops, salon and laundrette and all of them are so pleasant as you walk by and ask how you are.    We enjoyed our stay so much we extended by 3 nights. Since leaving we've compared other hotels to our room and wished we was back there.    Well done to the staff, you do an amazing job and you should be really proud of what you have achieved. An honest, reliable and welcoming place to stay.","W1A JOMTIEN - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.887975,100.881264&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.887975,100.881264&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.891585,100.874062|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.890499,100.879494|12.893726,100.876503|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.892040,100.873306|12.885211,100.881126|12.894398,100.874542&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950|12.884031,100.883522&signature=ac5JLxpOUcBRQ3ig6zqgrgPIBN0="
