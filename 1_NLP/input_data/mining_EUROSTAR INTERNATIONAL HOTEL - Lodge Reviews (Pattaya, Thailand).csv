Spider wrote a review Feb 2019,10,Bad Stay,"I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at a cost of 1000 baht per night. On the first day I reported a leaking toilet pipe in the bathroom, which was flooding the floor, the drain being uphill therefor the water could not run away. I reported it the second and third day. It was never fixed. The bathroom was the smallest one I have ever had in all of my traveling years.There was no curtain for the shower although the poles were there. Consequently more water all over the floor. After the first night I hung my card on the door requesting it be cleaned. I returned at 4 pm and it was not cleaned that day. The following morning my card was hung on the door once again. I returned at 4 pm still not cleaned. I reported it and they came to clean it at 6 pm. I had left the room while they cleaned it when I returned I was left one towel badly stained and my bed was not made up. The room had the lowest ceiling ever ( room 203 ) 6 ft 4 inches floor to ceiling. I am 6 ft so not a lot of clearance. The sheet on the bed had two big tears in it. The curtains were threadbare in places. I stayed at this hotel 11 years ago and it was tops. It has not been maintained and has a drab look to it. It should only be about 500 baht a night. Only thing good is position and Pool. No restaurant open while I was there. The receptionist was nice and friendly and was not her fault that management don't seem to care","EUROSTAR INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - Lodge Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.898100,100.868973&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.898100,100.868973&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.901447,100.868690|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.901821,100.869125|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.899477,100.865768|12.897036,100.868607|12.896251,100.869408|12.902000,100.869446&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.897312,100.871132|12.902089,100.869385|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118|12.901473,100.868446&signature=9fBaGeO0b3dgbLhE-sjGPoGx6hg="

Dads room wasnt cleaned two days running and ours on another day. The excuse they only have 1 cleaner for the whole hotel 30 bedrooms. Towels stained with holes, bedding ripped with big holes. The curtains thread bare , rooms totally unmaintained , leaking taps and toilets, dirt and mould and flys in bathroom. Really noisy and dirty fridge. Broken bed that meant changing rooms at midnight on first night. Aircon remote missing so on or off only . ( said guest took it ???) how long ago is unknown. Excuses for everything.

At my arrival at this Hotel nobody showed me to my room or helped with the Luggage.  In the Elevator to the 5th Floor I nearly fainted, foul smell, hot and very slow Lift.  The Room looked cold, old and had no character, like shown on their Website, very old patches of paint everywhere, didn’t make me feel comfortable.  At night time I felt I was on a Airplane from the Noise from the air conditioner unit from the Big Hotel next to this Hotel  The Bathroom looked the same old and run down. I had No hot water, no floor mat and the Bath Towels, where dirty stained and ripped.  I checked out from this Dump after only 2 Nights ,losing 350 AUD ,but I couldn't Stay in a Hotel like this.

At one point the waitress said to an elderly lady in the restaurant you are old and should know what a cappuccino is, my wife is Thai and couldn’t believe what she said.

There are some bars on the streets further up Jomtien Beach road not far away. During our stay they changed management, they seem to be renovating the rooms, changing beds and so on. My room was ok, bathroom wasnt the best but decent, well worth the price. The pool was good, nice place to stay if you are to lazy to go down the beach. The small bar was great, great staff, cold beer and a pool table, all you can ask for.

The standards of cleanliness have dropped to an unacceptable standard, it's really filthy and grubby nowadays and I'm afraid that after many years of being a loyal customer here I will NOT return.    The bathrooms are disgusting, the air cons are not serviced and hardly work in the heat of the day and the staff do not treat the customers with any respect.    To make matters worse the car park that has approx 5 spaces has 2 spaces reserved for the owner and nobody else can park there, so my car had to stay parked on the street whilst 2 spaces were empty...

Spider wrote a review Feb 2019,10,Bad Stay,"I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at a cost of 1000 baht per night. On the first day I reported a leaking toilet pipe in the bathroom, which was flooding the floor, the drain being uphill therefor the water could not run away. I reported it the second and third day. It was never fixed. The bathroom was the smallest one I have ever had in all of my traveling years.There was no curtain for the shower although the poles were there. Consequently more water all over the floor. After the first night I hung my card on the door requesting it be cleaned. I returned at 4 pm and it was not cleaned that day. The following morning my card was hung on the door once again. I returned at 4 pm still not cleaned. I reported it and they came to clean it at 6 pm. I had left the room while they cleaned it when I returned I was left one towel badly stained and my bed was not made up. The room had the lowest ceiling ever ( room 203 ) 6 ft 4 inches floor to ceiling. I am 6 ft so not a lot of clearance. The sheet on the bed had two big tears in it. The curtains were threadbare in places. I stayed at this hotel 11 years ago and it was tops. It has not been maintained and has a drab look to it. It should only be about 500 baht a night. Only thing good is position and Pool. No restaurant open while I was there.

Maria Machin wrote a review Feb 2019,10,Not fit to call itself a hotel,"We arrived at this dump for a 4 night holiday. Booking a twin room and a double. The pool and position of this hotel is great , however everything else about this place is rotten through and through. Its dirty  With little to no housekeeping at all. Dads room wasnt cleaned two days running and ours on another day. The excuse they only have 1 cleaner for the whole hotel 30 bedrooms. Towels stained with holes, bedding ripped with big holes. The curtains thread bare , rooms totally unmaintained , leaking taps and toilets, dirt and mould and flys in bathroom. Really noisy and dirty fridge. Broken bed that meant changing rooms at midnight on first night. Aircon remote missing so on or off only . ( said guest took it ???) how long ago is unknown. Excuses for everything. Restaurant and bar not open at all. I could go on and on , but my advice is avoid this place like the plague.

At my arrival at this Hotel nobody showed me to my room or helped with the Luggage.  In the Elevator to the 5th Floor I nearly fainted, foul smell, hot and very slow Lift.  The Room looked cold, old and had no character, like shown on their Website, very old patches of paint everywhere, didn’t make me feel comfortable.  At night time I felt I was on a Airplane from the Noise from the air conditioner unit from the Big Hotel next to this Hotel  The Bathroom looked the same old and run down. I had No hot water, no floor mat and the Bath Towels, where dirty stained and ripped.  I checked out from this Dump after only 2 Nights ,losing 350 AUD ,but I couldn't Stay in a Hotel like this.

Very poor customer service, the waitress was so rude when we complained and we would never go back.  At one point the waitress said to an elderly lady in the restaurant you are old and should know what a cappuccino is, my wife is Thai and couldn’t believe what she said.  I remembered this place as having good coffee this time is was ok but very weak and ordered another small cup to top up the Latte.

Tegian wrote a review Mar 2017,40,Worth the money,"A bit worn down hotel in a great location, a short walk down to the beach and the beach road, there you have a 7/11, a small market and varios (Pricey) farang resturants. There are some bars on the streets further up Jomtien Beach road not far away. During our stay they changed management, they seem to be renovating the rooms, changing beds and so on. My room was ok, bathroom wasnt the best but decent, well worth the price. The pool was good, nice place to stay if you are to lazy to go down the beach. The small bar was great, great staff, cold beer and a pool table, all you can ask for. The wi-fi worked very well , windows in the rooms open so you can smoke if you want.","EUROSTAR INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - Lodge Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.898100,100.868973&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.898100,100.868973&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.901447,100.868690|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.901821,100.869125|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.899477,100.865768|12.897036,100.868607|12.896251,100.869408|12.902000,100.869446&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.897312,100.871132|12.902089,100.869385|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118|12.901473,100.868446&signature=9fBaGeO0b3dgbLhE-sjGPoGx6hg="

The standards of cleanliness have dropped to an unacceptable standard, it's really filthy and grubby nowadays and I'm afraid that after many years of being a loyal customer here I will NOT return.    The bathrooms are disgusting, the air cons are not serviced and hardly work in the heat of the day and the staff do not treat the customers with any respect.    To make matters worse the car park that has approx 5 spaces has 2 spaces reserved for the owner and nobody else can park there, so my car had to stay parked on the street whilst 2 spaces were empty...
