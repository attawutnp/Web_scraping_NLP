Monika wrote a review Mar 2022,50,"Huge space, very helpful staff!","I was traveling alone and got a huge apartment on the top of the building just for myself. It was clean and comfortable, also internet was strong so I could easily work from there. The location was in a quiet area and around 10 minutes walking from the beach. I could see the sunset from my terrace. Neang was working there during the day and was always very helpful and caring, she reacted directly if I had any questions or need some help.

whitepointer wrote a review Dec 2019,40,Very good,"Everything works and the two-bedroom apartment had everything I needed. Air conditioning works fine however you will be required to pay extra for the use of electricity as the quoata they give is not enough. Distance to travel anywhere should be considered and would not be a problem for somebody with their on transport, however without you will need to pay for additional transport. Place can be difficult to find however a telephone call to the venue enabled the taxi driver to find the place.

892christian wrote a review Sep 2018,40,DISSAPOINTING,"I booked a 2 bedroom apartment at Butterfly Garden Boutique Residence after reading good reviews about the place. When I arrived with my family we found that all the kitchen cabinet doors were missing and the interior of the apartment - apart from the large flat screen TV - would have been better placed inside a museum. The entire decor of the apartment was old (or some might say retro) and the kitchen looked a complete mess. On the plus side, the staff were extremely pleasant and and apologized for the state of the apartment. The owner - who is American - stated told me she had to have the work done in the kitchen because that was the only time that her workmen could fit the job in. Of course, she could have blocked the sale of the room off rather than renting it out in the state it was in. The rooms are very big and represent good value for money - although I would rather pay more to have a more modern place to stay.","BUTTERFLY GARDEN BOUTIQUE RESIDENCE BY FRASIER - Updated 2022 Prices & Villa Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.911315,100.864922&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.911315,100.864922|12.911315,100.864922&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.910090,100.868752|12.915430,100.865410|12.912820,100.867783|12.910378,100.861671|12.909710,100.861954&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.911025,100.860687|12.910872,100.861397|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913967,100.867020|12.915426,100.866028|12.910090,100.868752|12.912574,100.866928&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.910049,100.863373|12.913057,100.863503|12.909583,100.865700|12.914198,100.867195|12.912065,100.868279|12.911901,100.860725&signature=zveWgbda54SiZWGiIHijpZUVnu4="

The accommodation I stayed in was a two bedroom apartment which was like home from home, everything from the air-con to the large TV was spot on, the internet was fast and never dropped out, the main bathroom had a large Jacuzzi hot tub which my little lad love, the swimming pool area is also very lovely surrounded by beautiful gardens. On our last day we were due to check out by 12noon but we weren’t being picked up for the airport until 4pm so the management team let us stay in the room till we got picked up free of charge which was a really kind of them. 4 adults and 1 child (10 year old) and we had plenty of space.  We will be coming back here again for sure.

TheFussyDiner wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Great for many reasons,"New or near new furniture in all rooms, huge apartments with decks, great cable TV and modern television with YouTube apps built-in (great for kids), full size European style kitchen with 6 gas burners, I could go on...    Okay let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first. Yes they do charge for electricity but only if you go over the daily allowance.    My family of four stayed here for 10 days and we used the air conditioner in two rooms every days for hours, and we did not pay any extra for electricity.    I now understand why they charge for electricity. This is essentially a full modern residential apartment and our unit had FOUR air conditioning units, fans and many lights. If they didn't have this policy, unfortunately some guests would take advantage of it and leave all their air conditioners on all day long even when it is not occupied.    The only thing you need to be aware of is that they charge a security deposit from memory 3000 baht which you get back at the end of your stay if you haven't broken anything (which is often a nice surprise because you have already forgotten you spent it!).    And that they only accept cash not for any other reason than Thai banks make it almost impossible for independent hotel to get CC faciltiies, so make sure you know the total to pay and exchange the appropriate money before arriving or you could just walk to an ATM (about 6 mins away).    There are taxis at the end of the street about 75 metres away who can take you anywhere in Pattaya. No they do not use the meter, but that is normal. For your benefit here is what I paid after some negotiation:    150 BAHT - Royal Cliff Beach Resort (Close)  150 BAHT - Royal Garden Plaza (Central Pattaya)  150 BAHT - Harbor Mall (25 min drive)  200 BAHT - Central Pattaya (was feeling generous)    So although the main road where you can get a Songtaew is 600m (a 7 minute walk), you can easily get a taxi anytime for a fairly reasonable price.    Try getting the same quality of apartment closer to Central Pattaya for this price!    TIP 1: If you want good quality restaurant food close by visit Tara Court Hotel (600m). They also do takeaway.    TIP 2: The nearest convenience store is about 350M away.    TIP 3: There is a small Ma and Pa convenience store open during the day and early evening about 150M to grab snacks, beer etc.    TIP 4: When coming back in a taxi all you need to know is ""SOI 6 PRAHTUMNAK"" just learn how to say that and you will be fine, and shouldn't pay more than 200 baht anywhere in Pattaya to get back.    The pool area was lovely but didn't seem that utilised, and the gardens are lovely. This is a quiet area, very little noise inside the apartment.    Perfect for families, groups and even singles or couples as check out their 1 bedroom prices, ridiculously good value for money.    This area is essentially a suburb, with local amenities for residents and is not touristy at all.","BUTTERFLY GARDEN BOUTIQUE RESIDENCE BY FRASIER - Updated 2022 Prices & Villa Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.911315,100.864922&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.911315,100.864922|12.911315,100.864922&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.910090,100.868752|12.915430,100.865410|12.912820,100.867783|12.910378,100.861671|12.909710,100.861954&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.911025,100.860687|12.910872,100.861397|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913967,100.867020|12.915426,100.866028|12.910090,100.868752|12.912574,100.866928&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.910049,100.863373|12.913057,100.863503|12.909583,100.865700|12.914198,100.867195|12.912065,100.868279|12.911901,100.860725&signature=zveWgbda54SiZWGiIHijpZUVnu4="
MrBrazilian wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Your Own Private Luxury Spa in the middle of Paradise Pattaya,"I went to Thailand in November 2016 for the first time as a solo traveler. I've been traveling by myself for years and I have been to over 40 countries, however this was the first time visiting Asia.    Being originally from Rio de Janeiro, I thought: ""Okay, English is not their first language here, but I'm sure I can communicate"". Surprisingly most Thailandese can't go any further than ""where you from?"", so I found it very hard to find information at the places I've stayed at, and the staff seemed mostly disinterested.    I was so lucky to have found Butterfly Garden Boutique Residence by Frasier! I wasn't sure what to expect, so initially I only booked 3 nights, but as soon as I walked into the property I went straight online and booked another 4 nights!    The place is amazing, it felt so good to finally be somewhere comfortable and welcoming. Not to mention the spa bath in the bathroom, what a treat... The owner, an American lady who has so much travel knowledge and willingness to help... She personally checked me in and out, helped me with tips about the area, suggested flights to Phuket and booked my transfer to the airport. I hope you are reading this because I want you to know that this kind of attitude is what makes a business successful.    Already planning my next visit and this time I will not waste time or money: will be staying here again, 100%.","BUTTERFLY GARDEN BOUTIQUE RESIDENCE BY FRASIER - Updated 2022 Prices & Villa Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.911315,100.864922&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.911315,100.864922|12.911315,100.864922&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.910090,100.868752|12.915430,100.865410|12.912820,100.867783|12.910378,100.861671|12.909710,100.861954&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.911025,100.860687|12.910872,100.861397|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913967,100.867020|12.915426,100.866028|12.910090,100.868752|12.912574,100.866928&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.910049,100.863373|12.913057,100.863503|12.909583,100.865700|12.914198,100.867195|12.912065,100.868279|12.911901,100.860725&signature=zveWgbda54SiZWGiIHijpZUVnu4="

Marcia K wrote a review Feb 2016,50,A Wonderful Gem!,"I was recently traveling in Thailand for the first time, on my own. I wanted to visit Pattaya, south of Bangkok, both to be near the beach and because I like places where there are more Europeans and Asians than Americans. I found this place called Butterfly Garden, which I loved. Stayed for 4 days, in a 2-bedroom condo. The setting is behind locked filigreed gates (as a woman alone, I appreciated that security), through which you enter into a little paradise of a well-kept garden of flowering trees and plants. At the center is a lovely pool. Each unit seems like a world unto itself: mine had its own little gate, a private patio with high walls where I was totally invisible to others, and sliding doors into the very spacious unit. All the dishes and tools I’d need to cook for myself were in the kitchen, as well as a basket of toiletries and plenty of towels in the bathroom. There were 4 different A/C units, so I could keep the living room cooler and the bedrooms a little warmer. Beds were comfortable with firm mattresses and plenty of pillows, and there was plenty of closet and drawer space. Shower was very modern. Unit was spotlessly clean. Jill the manager was a total delight: a warm, funny and totally helpful lady who seemed to know the answer to every single question I had. The restaurants she suggested were all terrific. The Thai staff were quiet, efficient and unobtrusive. Location is great as well: near all the shops including places to buy food to cook, easy walk to the beach, but totally quiet and almost ‘cloistered’. I regret I didn’t plan to stay longer, but I hope to return next year on my way to other sights in Thailand that I didn’t get to on this trip.","BUTTERFLY GARDEN BOUTIQUE RESIDENCE BY FRASIER - Updated 2022 Prices & Villa Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.911315,100.864922&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.911315,100.864922|12.911315,100.864922&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.910090,100.868752|12.915430,100.865410|12.912820,100.867783|12.910378,100.861671|12.909710,100.861954&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.911025,100.860687|12.910872,100.861397|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913967,100.867020|12.915426,100.866028|12.910090,100.868752|12.912574,100.866928&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.910049,100.863373|12.913057,100.863503|12.909583,100.865700|12.914198,100.867195|12.912065,100.868279|12.911901,100.860725&signature=zveWgbda54SiZWGiIHijpZUVnu4="

892christian wrote a review Sep 2018,40,DISSAPOINTING,"I booked a 2 bedroom apartment at Butterfly Garden Boutique Residence after reading good reviews about the place. When I arrived with my family we found that all the kitchen cabinet doors were missing and the interior of the apartment - apart from the large flat screen TV - would have been better placed inside a museum. The entire decor of the apartment was old (or some might say retro) and the kitchen looked a complete mess. On the plus side, the staff were extremely pleasant and and apologized for the state of the apartment. The owner - who is American - stated told me she had to have the work done in the kitchen because that was the only time that her workmen could fit the job in. Of course, she could have blocked the sale of the room off rather than renting it out in the state it was in. The rooms are very big and represent good value for money - although I would rather pay more to have a more modern place to stay.","BUTTERFLY GARDEN BOUTIQUE RESIDENCE BY FRASIER - Updated 2022 Prices & Villa Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.911315,100.864922&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.911315,100.864922|12.911315,100.864922&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.910090,100.868752|12.915430,100.865410|12.912820,100.867783|12.910378,100.861671|12.909710,100.861954&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.911025,100.860687|12.910872,100.861397|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913967,100.867020|12.915426,100.866028|12.910090,100.868752|12.912574,100.866928&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.910049,100.863373|12.913057,100.863503|12.909583,100.865700|12.914198,100.867195|12.912065,100.868279|12.911901,100.860725&signature=zveWgbda54SiZWGiIHijpZUVnu4="
Matt W wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Fantastic stay,"Having stayed in Thailand many time with my family the Butterfly Garden is by far the best place I’ve stayed, the staff were very friendly and always happy to help. The accommodation I stayed in was a two bedroom apartment which was like home from home, everything from the air-con to the large TV was spot on, the internet was fast and never dropped out, the main bathroom had a large Jacuzzi hot tub which my little lad love, the swimming pool area is also very lovely surrounded by beautiful gardens. On our last day we were due to check out by 12noon but we weren’t being picked up for the airport until 4pm so the management team let us stay in the room till we got picked up free of charge which was a really kind of them. 4 adults and 1 child (10 year old) and we had plenty of space.  We will be coming back here again for sure.

TheFussyDiner wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Great for many reasons,"New or near new furniture in all rooms, huge apartments with decks, great cable TV and modern television with YouTube apps built-in (great for kids), full size European style kitchen with 6 gas burners, I could go on...    Okay let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first. Yes they do charge for electricity but only if you go over the daily allowance.    My family of four stayed here for 10 days and we used the air conditioner in two rooms every days for hours, and we did not pay any extra for electricity.    I now understand why they charge for electricity. This is essentially a full modern residential apartment and our unit had FOUR air conditioning units, fans and many lights. If they didn't have this policy, unfortunately some guests would take advantage of it and leave all their air conditioners on all day long even when it is not occupied.    The only thing you need to be aware of is that they charge a security deposit from memory 3000 baht which you get back at the end of your stay if you haven't broken anything (which is often a nice surprise because you have already forgotten you spent it!).    And that they only accept cash not for any other reason than Thai banks make it almost impossible for independent hotel to get CC faciltiies, so make sure you know the total to pay and exchange the appropriate money before arriving or you could just walk to an ATM (about 6 mins away).    There are taxis at the end of the street about 75 metres away who can take you anywhere in Pattaya. No they do not use the meter, but that is normal. For your benefit here is what I paid after some negotiation:    150 BAHT - Royal Cliff Beach Resort (Close)  150 BAHT - Royal Garden Plaza (Central Pattaya)  150 BAHT - Harbor Mall (25 min drive)  200 BAHT - Central Pattaya (was feeling generous)    So although the main road where you can get a Songtaew is 600m (a 7 minute walk), you can easily get a taxi anytime for a fairly reasonable price.    Try getting the same quality of apartment closer to Central Pattaya for this price!    TIP 1: If you want good quality restaurant food close by visit Tara Court Hotel (600m). They also do takeaway.    TIP 2: The nearest convenience store is about 350M away.    TIP 3: There is a small Ma and Pa convenience store open during the day and early evening about 150M to grab snacks, beer etc.    TIP 4: When coming back in a taxi all you need to know is ""SOI 6 PRAHTUMNAK"" just learn how to say that and you will be fine, and shouldn't pay more than 200 baht anywhere in Pattaya to get back.    The pool area was lovely but didn't seem that utilised, and the gardens are lovely. This is a quiet area, very little noise inside the apartment.    Perfect for families, groups and even singles or couples as check out their 1 bedroom prices, ridiculously good value for money.    This area is essentially a suburb, with local amenities for residents and is not touristy at all.","BUTTERFLY GARDEN BOUTIQUE RESIDENCE BY FRASIER - Updated 2022 Prices & Villa Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.911315,100.864922&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.911315,100.864922|12.911315,100.864922&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.910090,100.868752|12.915430,100.865410|12.912820,100.867783|12.910378,100.861671|12.909710,100.861954&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.911025,100.860687|12.910872,100.861397|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913967,100.867020|12.915426,100.866028|12.910090,100.868752|12.912574,100.866928&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.910049,100.863373|12.913057,100.863503|12.909583,100.865700|12.914198,100.867195|12.912065,100.868279|12.911901,100.860725&signature=zveWgbda54SiZWGiIHijpZUVnu4="
MrBrazilian wrote a review Oct 2017,50,Your Own Private Luxury Spa in the middle of Paradise Pattaya,"I went to Thailand in November 2016 for the first time as a solo traveler. I've been traveling by myself for years and I have been to over 40 countries, however this was the first time visiting Asia.    Being originally from Rio de Janeiro, I thought: ""Okay, English is not their first language here, but I'm sure I can communicate"". Surprisingly most Thailandese can't go any further than ""where you from?"", so I found it very hard to find information at the places I've stayed at, and the staff seemed mostly disinterested.    I was so lucky to have found Butterfly Garden Boutique Residence by Frasier! I wasn't sure what to expect, so initially I only booked 3 nights, but as soon as I walked into the property I went straight online and booked another 4 nights!    The place is amazing, it felt so good to finally be somewhere comfortable and welcoming. Not to mention the spa bath in the bathroom, what a treat... The owner, an American lady who has so much travel knowledge and willingness to help... She personally checked me in and out, helped me with tips about the area, suggested flights to Phuket and booked my transfer to the airport. I hope you are reading this because I want you to know that this kind of attitude is what makes a business successful.

Marcia K wrote a review Feb 2016,50,A Wonderful Gem!,"I was recently traveling in Thailand for the first time, on my own. I wanted to visit Pattaya, south of Bangkok, both to be near the beach and because I like places where there are more Europeans and Asians than Americans. I found this place called Butterfly Garden, which I loved. Stayed for 4 days, in a 2-bedroom condo. The setting is behind locked filigreed gates (as a woman alone, I appreciated that security), through which you enter into a little paradise of a well-kept garden of flowering trees and plants. At the center is a lovely pool. Each unit seems like a world unto itself: mine had its own little gate, a private patio with high walls where I was totally invisible to others, and sliding doors into the very spacious unit. All the dishes and tools I’d need to cook for myself were in the kitchen, as well as a basket of toiletries and plenty of towels in the bathroom. There were 4 different A/C units, so I could keep the living room cooler and the bedrooms a little warmer. Beds were comfortable with firm mattresses and plenty of pillows, and there was plenty of closet and drawer space. Shower was very modern. Unit was spotlessly clean. Jill the manager was a total delight: a warm, funny and totally helpful lady who seemed to know the answer to every single question I had. The restaurants she suggested were all terrific. The Thai staff were quiet, efficient and unobtrusive. Location is great as well: near all the shops including places to buy food to cook, easy walk to the beach, but totally quiet and almost ‘cloistered’. I regret I didn’t plan to stay longer, but I hope to return next year on my way to other sights in Thailand that I didn’t get to on this trip.","BUTTERFLY GARDEN BOUTIQUE RESIDENCE BY FRASIER - Updated 2022 Prices & Villa Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.911315,100.864922&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.911315,100.864922|12.911315,100.864922&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.910090,100.868752|12.915430,100.865410|12.912820,100.867783|12.910378,100.861671|12.909710,100.861954&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.911025,100.860687|12.910872,100.861397|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913967,100.867020|12.915426,100.866028|12.910090,100.868752|12.912574,100.866928&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.910049,100.863373|12.913057,100.863503|12.909583,100.865700|12.914198,100.867195|12.912065,100.868279|12.911901,100.860725&signature=zveWgbda54SiZWGiIHijpZUVnu4="
