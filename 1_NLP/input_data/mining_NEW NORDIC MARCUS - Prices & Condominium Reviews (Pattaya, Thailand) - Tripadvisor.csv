tlp64 wrote a review Feb 2018,20,Out dated needing refurbishment,"Stayed at New nordic Kristin a couple of years ago and room was fine but had to use Marcus for breakfast and pool. So decided to stay in New nordic again and was put in the Marcus. I haven't seen one member of staff smile (except guy checking us in) with the building needing refurbishment. The bright orange in some places are dull, the sink in the room is cracked, the roof on one of the buildings is all flakey. The roof top pool has edge tiles missing whereby I nearly cut myself. Currently they are clearing out the main pool (had event so was boarded) with the worker drilling the metal pipes on the water with electric drill and plug socket on his body. One slip and that's it. New nordic are vastly expanding but they need to maintain what they have. Not impressed compared to last stay. Uncertain if I would choose again. Dust and rust in pool. Got a suspicion that they will not be draining but put cleaning solution in - yuk!!!!!","NEW NORDIC MARCUS - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.915245,100.862549&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.915245,100.862549&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.924710,100.867577|12.920770,100.866524|12.923032,100.868019|12.921944,100.866280|12.909230,100.858452|12.919580,100.867058|12.924372,100.868126|12.916930,100.866753&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.913368,100.873314|12.923379,100.859665|12.911025,100.860687|12.922490,100.859955|12.924771,100.860611|12.910872,100.861397|12.923467,100.859528|12.915442,100.857048|12.913666,100.870483&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.922674,100.859497|12.924386,100.859207|12.911690,100.871002|12.923552,100.859947|12.910459,100.868332|12.923232,100.859421|12.925546,100.861938|12.913719,100.867088|12.923741,100.869438&signature=uRzG9kuqkgRoUxi-p_lRSUiDSfw="

Walter W wrote a review Jan 2016,30,Ok and safe,"If you want a clean and relatively new place to stay, hotel Marcus is an allright deal : value for Money. Roughly 2300 bath incl. Breakfast for standard room, is a fair price. 10 minutes walk to the beach and approx. the same time by cab to Pattaya center.  5 stars in their logo outside the hotel, have nothing to do with reality, and can therefor only be looked at the same way, a 7 star greek Metaxa brandy, is standing in comparance with cognac :-).    New Nordic group is expanding, and there is some construction work going on in the area. They are offering another room in their complex, if the noise is bothering, but since construction is going on in all directions, that does'nd really help. The staff is mostly very friendly, but seems to be poorly trained. We experienced, and observed several unnessercary episodes, leading to annoyed guests. Especialy the breakfast was not up to standard, so that we and some other guests decidet to drop breakfast at the hotel, and rather bought one further down the street, at a local place.  Once construction is completed, and with a better trained staff, combined with a gueranteed breakfast standard, the satisfaction score could easely reach 4-5 , but for now, 3 is generous enough.","NEW NORDIC MARCUS - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.915245,100.862549&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.915245,100.862549&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.924710,100.867577|12.920770,100.866524|12.923032,100.868019|12.921944,100.866280|12.909230,100.858452|12.919580,100.867058|12.924372,100.868126|12.916930,100.866753&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.913368,100.873314|12.923379,100.859665|12.911025,100.860687|12.922490,100.859955|12.924771,100.860611|12.910872,100.861397|12.923467,100.859528|12.915442,100.857048|12.913666,100.870483&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.922674,100.859497|12.924386,100.859207|12.911690,100.871002|12.923552,100.859947|12.910459,100.868332|12.923232,100.859421|12.925546,100.861938|12.913719,100.867088|12.923741,100.869438&signature=uRzG9kuqkgRoUxi-p_lRSUiDSfw="

tlp64 wrote a review Feb 2018,20,Out dated needing refurbishment,"Stayed at New nordic Kristin a couple of years ago and room was fine but had to use Marcus for breakfast and pool. So decided to stay in New nordic again and was put in the Marcus. I haven't seen one member of staff smile (except guy checking us in) with the building needing refurbishment. The bright orange in some places are dull, the sink in the room is cracked, the roof on one of the buildings is all flakey. The roof top pool has edge tiles missing whereby I nearly cut myself. Currently they are clearing out the main pool (had event so was boarded) with the worker drilling the metal pipes on the water with electric drill and plug socket on his body. One slip and that's it. New nordic are vastly expanding but they need to maintain what they have. Not impressed compared to last stay. Uncertain if I would choose again. Dust and rust in pool. Got a suspicion that they will not be draining but put cleaning solution in - yuk!!!!!","NEW NORDIC MARCUS - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.915245,100.862549&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.915245,100.862549&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.924710,100.867577|12.920770,100.866524|12.923032,100.868019|12.921944,100.866280|12.909230,100.858452|12.919580,100.867058|12.924372,100.868126|12.916930,100.866753&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.913368,100.873314|12.923379,100.859665|12.911025,100.860687|12.922490,100.859955|12.924771,100.860611|12.910872,100.861397|12.923467,100.859528|12.915442,100.857048|12.913666,100.870483&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.922674,100.859497|12.924386,100.859207|12.911690,100.871002|12.923552,100.859947|12.910459,100.868332|12.923232,100.859421|12.925546,100.861938|12.913719,100.867088|12.923741,100.869438&signature=uRzG9kuqkgRoUxi-p_lRSUiDSfw="

Walter W wrote a review Jan 2016,30,Ok and safe,"If you want a clean and relatively new place to stay, hotel Marcus is an allright deal : value for Money. Roughly 2300 bath incl. Breakfast for standard room, is a fair price. 10 minutes walk to the beach and approx. the same time by cab to Pattaya center.  5 stars in their logo outside the hotel, have nothing to do with reality, and can therefor only be looked at the same way, a 7 star greek Metaxa brandy, is standing in comparance with cognac :-).    New Nordic group is expanding, and there is some construction work going on in the area. They are offering another room in their complex, if the noise is bothering, but since construction is going on in all directions, that does'nd really help. The staff is mostly very friendly, but seems to be poorly trained. We experienced, and observed several unnessercary episodes, leading to annoyed guests. Especialy the breakfast was not up to standard, so that we and some other guests decidet to drop breakfast at the hotel, and rather bought one further down the street, at a local place.  Once construction is completed, and with a better trained staff, combined with a gueranteed breakfast standard, the satisfaction score could easely reach 4-5 , but for now, 3 is generous enough.","NEW NORDIC MARCUS - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.915245,100.862549&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.915245,100.862549&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.924710,100.867577|12.920770,100.866524|12.923032,100.868019|12.921944,100.866280|12.909230,100.858452|12.919580,100.867058|12.924372,100.868126|12.916930,100.866753&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.913368,100.873314|12.923379,100.859665|12.911025,100.860687|12.922490,100.859955|12.924771,100.860611|12.910872,100.861397|12.923467,100.859528|12.915442,100.857048|12.913666,100.870483&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.922674,100.859497|12.924386,100.859207|12.911690,100.871002|12.923552,100.859947|12.910459,100.868332|12.923232,100.859421|12.925546,100.861938|12.913719,100.867088|12.923741,100.869438&signature=uRzG9kuqkgRoUxi-p_lRSUiDSfw="
