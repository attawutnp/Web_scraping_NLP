chseaston wrote a review Sep 2019,50,Great location and friendly staff.,"I have stayed here on my past 3 trips. The rooms are nice (especially the biggest ones) and you can't beat the location. I wish the prices were just a little bit lower, but the staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean and secure. It's still a good value and they will continue to get my business.","PASADENA LODGE - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930491,100.884247&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930491,100.884247&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.930410,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.934750,100.883934|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.930620,100.879997|12.931198,100.886253&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=GQltyNCcYhW7yuSArr5dzyavrSY="

Brendan H wrote a review Jan 2017,30,Tarnished with unexpected cost at check out,"Stayed here for 11 nights and really impressed with the size of the Superior Room. It had plenty of room for storage, Dining table and even a banana lounge. It had also been tastefully decorated. And the blackout curtains made it easy to sleep in.    I was so disappointed to to be charged for the two small bottles of water that was left in my fridge each day when I checked out.    I have been traveling to Thailand for 25 year and every hotel leaves you bottles of complimentary water each day. There was no price list anywhere in my room that indicated the water was not complimentary. And there was definitely not alcohol in the fridge that would indicated it was a mini bar.    And if you sleep in past 2pm ( which so many of us do when visiting Soi Metro) then don't expect to get your room cleaned","PASADENA LODGE - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930491,100.884247&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930491,100.884247&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.930410,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.934750,100.883934|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.930620,100.879997|12.931198,100.886253&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=GQltyNCcYhW7yuSArr5dzyavrSY="

onomataho wrote a review Feb 2014,30,"Good, but could be better","I've stayed here a number of times in the past five years. I keep going back because it is a decent hotel in a good location. It hasn't changed much, but has held up fairly well. It's located in the middle of a growing ""entertainment"" district, so if you're looking for ""fun"" this is a good base. My recent stay was with my family and there was no issues with having our young daughter with us. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.    Pros: Clean, good value, elevator, comfortable firm bed, quiet rooms in the back, nice lobby, parking, wifi good except at peak times. Cons: Needs some upgrades, old TV, no room to put things in the bathroom, uncomfortable chair in room.    My main gripe is the surly owner, He's an older who guy never says hello, smiles, or greets guests. I don't know what his problem is?

GuZhongWen wrote a review Apr 2013,10,"Nice Hotel, but I got robbed by the staff","The Hotel is very well located, the rooms are okay and relatively clean - because of it's location it is a little bít noisy, but still not as noisy as you would expect it in one of pattayas partyzones.    Anyway - unfortunately I got robbed by supposedly by one of the frontdeskmanagers. They are the only ones who have access to the keys for roomsafes. Originally I wanted to check out on a Saturday - but the I decided to stay longer, the next day I realized that money was missing. They took not all the money: 200 Euros, 200 Ringgit and 100 Singpore Dollars - any other thief would have taken all the money and my camera, my passport and my iPhone. And of course the thief would not have locked the safe again.    So I suppose that one of them, expecting me to check out on the next day, entered my room, opened the safe, took some of the money and though, that I would realize it only when i left already. The whole issue was very disappointing. I had the impression the only person who really cared about it and was upset, was the cleaning maid, who cleaned my room every day but had no access to the safekeys. The police did also not care very much - they offered me to write a paper for my insurance...wtf?!?

livinginthehat wrote a review Aug 2012,40,Loved it.,"Stayed here in May and enjoyed every moment here.    I usually stay in cheaper guesthouses, but decided to pay the 2-300 baht extra and give this hotel a try. I will always stay here when I'm in Pattaya now.    I tried two different rooms, a superior room and a deluxe room. Both were tastefully decorated, comfortable, very clean and safe. Had big TV's with satellite channels, a mini bar and great bathrooms. I don't have a preference between the two rooms as both were fantastic.    The staff were really cool, very helpful with great English and didn't seem to mind when I extended my booking a little as i was unorganized.    The noise was a minor issue, but that's expected anywhere on Soi LK Metro. If you like peace and quiet, maybe this isn't for you. But it didn't bother me at all.    LK Metro is my favourite soi in Pattaya as i don't like to venture on to walking street too much. It's more chilled out with some great bars and people around. I suspect more hotels like Pasadena will surface in the future.","PASADENA LODGE - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930491,100.884247&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930491,100.884247&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.930410,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.934750,100.883934|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.930620,100.879997|12.931198,100.886253&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=GQltyNCcYhW7yuSArr5dzyavrSY="

EnforcerFan wrote a review Apr 2012,40,"An unexpected, delightful find","This property was an unexpected find on LK Metro. It is in the corner of this very popular entertainment area, which makes it surprisingly quiet. This entertainment area tends to be more blue collar than Walking Street, and the prices reflect this. Nevertheless, the lobby is done as nicely as any high end hotel, and the recently refurbished rooms run from exceptional but small to quite roomy. The staff is quite friendly and funny. The bar is just for decoration at the moment, and there is no food. Very well stocked mini-bar. The in room safe is too small for a lap top. Free wifi. Large, well appointed bathroom, but it is a Thai toilet (do not flush paper products). A/C unit could be better. However, for about $3 more per night than the closets that pass for rooms elsewhere on the Soi, it rocks! I will stay again.

rielly62 wrote a review Feb 2012,40,Nice simple hotel,"I stayed here for 5 nights and the stay was quite pleasant. I booked the larger room which is 1,500 Bahts and it was a good size room and it was clean and comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly and did their best to help where they could. The location is quite good, it can be a little noisy at times but then most parts of Pattaya are pretty much the same. There are plenty of good places to eat and drink nearby. So even though there in no Breakfast etc at the hotel there are many options for that close by for around 100 Bahts or so.  I read on of the previous reviews where they said their room was burgled by someone coming in from the balcony. My balcony door had 2 locks and by locking both of these i never had any problems.  The rooms are non smoking but you can smoke on the balcony if required.","PASADENA LODGE - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930491,100.884247&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930491,100.884247&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.930410,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.934750,100.883934|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.930620,100.879997|12.931198,100.886253&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=GQltyNCcYhW7yuSArr5dzyavrSY="

The hotel was generally very clean and the housekeeping did a great job. Front office staff was really pleasant and had gone out of the way to assist their guests.The hotel was surrounded by a very nice nightlife area where one can get almost anything one desire.

kwaidum wrote a review Jul 2011,30,There's no deadbolt,"Surprise, surprise, some strange dude walked in on me while I was lounging around in my boxer briefs.    Okay, okay, I am not sure I locked the door. He was using his key to open the door to his room down the hall. But the thing is, I am in the habit of using the deadbolt when I am in the room, and there wasn't one. So there's a safety concern.    Other than that, the room is okay. There's a big bed, but don't get excited, it's a pair of twin mattresses pushed together, so there's a ridge in the middle.    TV with local Pattaya cable channels. Refrigerator full of beers and soda that you can shuffle around make room for you own stuff. Closet space. But oddly, no hangers.    The bathroom is in an odd place, through a set of patio doors on the way to the window/veranda, as if the bathroom is the patio. There is a distinct lack of towel bars. Or hot water. And I guess it must be a city mandate that they use that blue stuff in the toilet bowl.    The veranda itself is not much to speak of. It's a narrow affair with room for a single chair. You have to step over the table to sit in the chair. It's not terribly well thought out. It overlooks another hotel's balcony and a narrow canyon of concrete, rooftops, spikes and barbed wire. It's not really a view to speak of, but at least there's sunlight.    Soi LK Metro, center of which this L-shaped street the hotel is located, is a street of go-go bars, pubs, golf-player hangouts and billiards places. So there's lots of loud music, shouting and cracking of pool balls throughout the night. The hotel itself is fairly quiet at night, but the surroundings can't be helped.    Virtually every pub and go-go bar on this street advertises rooms for rent, but the Pasadena Lodge is the only actual hotel on the street. It poses itself as a sort-of boutique hotel, but despite the faux-Thai handicraft decor, cute-colored soap and elephant-shaped towels, it's really just another hotel.    If you are going to be hanging out on the street or the nearby area, and don't mind the noise, this is an okay hotel. Otherwise, move along and find a place near the beach.","PASADENA LODGE - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930491,100.884247&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930491,100.884247&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.930410,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.934750,100.883934|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.930620,100.879997|12.931198,100.886253&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=GQltyNCcYhW7yuSArr5dzyavrSY="
