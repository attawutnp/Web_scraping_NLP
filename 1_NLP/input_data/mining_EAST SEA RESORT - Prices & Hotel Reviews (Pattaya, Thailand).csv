MikeyIdea wrote a review Feb 2016,10,Run down and old with bungalows smelling mould for way too high price,"I am very disappointed. The place is old and run down. The pillows in the bungalow smelled strongly of mould making the whole bungalow smell and even worse:    There are lots of broken tiles in the swimming pools, my daughter cut herself on one broken tile and came bleeding to me. I politely complained at the reception showing them my daughters cut hand and the blood but they did not care and the older lady there actually even turned her back and walked away from me and my daughter when I was not willing to accept her ignorance of what had happened    I found the behaviour unacceptable and requested to escalate to the owner (which I heard was a German) but the “Thai Resort Management” I was allowed to talk to was certainly not management and no different. The attitude, although not the exact words I got was: If you don’t like it here go somewhere else, not accepting to refund the money I already had paid in advance    I requested to have the mould coloured smelly pillows replaced and was refused, I brought them to the reception to let the staff smell them and look at the discolouring and was refused again. I ended up buying new pillows at Big C that we used for the week I was there as I was refused refund and couldn’t really afford to pay for a second place too for my family    I have stayed at East Sea Resort once in the past, about 10 years ago, and I was surprised and disappointed with how the place obviously has not been maintained, how run down it is now, and the behaviour of the staff. Bungalows are 1200 baht and 1800 baht (end of 2015) and there are many places in Pattaya Na Klua that offer a much better experience for that price.    The resort restaurant prices are at the high end and service was slow. There is another place just down the road that offer buffet breakfast and better food for much lower prices, check it out    The nature around the swimming pools is nice and that is the only thing East Sea Resort has to offer really.    I strongly advice to look somewhere else","EAST SEA RESORT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.953861,100.886101&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.953861,100.886101&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.951410,100.887962|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.951634,100.887924|12.956288,100.889046|12.952541,100.888657|12.951286,100.887779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.954279,100.883163|12.953860,100.887932|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589|12.951778,100.884003|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191&signature=hmGF5GWonfo2q9pJPNxqdsnMKlI="

Tegian wrote a review Dec 2015,20,Poor value,"Stayed in a worn down bungalow close to one of their pools, holes in a bridge, broken tiles all over area, this resort really really needs an update. Food/drink prizes high and they were understaffed (With Thai standards). All that being said the pools are nice if old an atleast our pool had a pool bar, another plus is the location easy to find not far off beach road and there are some bars and resturants close by.    Not worth the 1 800 bath we paid, there are many better places around in Pattaya for that price but not a total disaster for a night or two.","EAST SEA RESORT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.953861,100.886101&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.953861,100.886101&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.951410,100.887962|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.951634,100.887924|12.956288,100.889046|12.952541,100.888657|12.951286,100.887779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.954279,100.883163|12.953860,100.887932|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589|12.951778,100.884003|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191&signature=hmGF5GWonfo2q9pJPNxqdsnMKlI="
eric312659 wrote a review Apr 2015,20,Very disappointing....,"Having used East Sea yearly on eight or nine other occasions as our golf tour base,this time around it was extremly disappointing.  We should have seen it coming as, we mentioned between ourselves that nothing in the way of upgrading or maintenance had been evident over the years we had stayed there. Most of the efforts seems to have been directed at the new East Sea Paradise 4 wing.  East Sea 1 is tired, run down and in desperate need of a real spruce up.  The outside bar area although functioning during the day has been stripped and now closes at 8.00pm. This was our meeting point after golf and before going out in the evening. Hugely missed there is simply nothing else on offer to guests.  At TB1300.00 per day without breakfast it is ridiculously overpriced. There are many better hotels nearby offering much better value and I suggest you look for an alternative.  Speaking of our golf tour group and we have spent a great deal of money over the years this will definitely be our last visit. Sad to say that looking at managements attitude it will make little difference.","EAST SEA RESORT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.953861,100.886101&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.953861,100.886101&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.951410,100.887962|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.951634,100.887924|12.956288,100.889046|12.952541,100.888657|12.951286,100.887779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.954279,100.883163|12.953860,100.887932|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589|12.951778,100.884003|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191&signature=hmGF5GWonfo2q9pJPNxqdsnMKlI="

The rooms were budget which is understandable considering the relatively low price compared to other hotels around. There were many mosquitoes in the whole hotel but it does not look like it was a concern for the management.    All in all, would not have stayed there if I didn't needed to be close to that area.","EAST SEA RESORT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.953861,100.886101&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.953861,100.886101&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.951410,100.887962|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.951634,100.887924|12.956288,100.889046|12.952541,100.888657|12.951286,100.887779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.954279,100.883163|12.953860,100.887932|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589|12.951778,100.884003|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191&signature=hmGF5GWonfo2q9pJPNxqdsnMKlI="
eric312659 wrote a review Mar 2013,30,not the Hilton but neither is the price!,"I have stayed here on a couple of occasions while on golf vacations.  Okay, its not 5 star but as a base if you are not over fussy about rhe fineries it is excellent value and in a good location in Norh Pattaya near Dolphin Circle.  Accomodation is chalet type with two ajoining apartments.    Bedrooms are O.K. and offer either double or two single beds. I found the mattresses hard but slept like a baby, so how bad can they be?  Adjoining toilet and shower area, has basic amenities and had adequate hot water for washing or showering. I visited a supermarket nearbye and stocked up on the usual shampoo and soap etc.  This is advisable as there is little on offer and it was not replenished daily.  The room had good air conditioning, mini bar and TV.    I did not eat in the restaurant, apart from a couple of breakfasts. From memory it was just O.K. but there are many eating establishments a short distance from the hotel to suit all tastes and pockets.  The swimming area is very nice and good for children and adults. Watch out for the suction outlets in the pool, they are extremely powerful and I brought this to managements attention as it could pose a real danger for children.    I found the staff all round to be exceptionally helpful and friendly, esecially Bo and her sister who look after the bar and coffee area.    Summing up a decent little place to stay, basic and not pretentious. Far enough away from the madness of downtown Pattaya it is very easy and cheap to get around.    Recommended if you are not expecting anything other than adequate accomodation.","EAST SEA RESORT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.953861,100.886101&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.953861,100.886101&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.951410,100.887962|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.951634,100.887924|12.956288,100.889046|12.952541,100.888657|12.951286,100.887779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.954279,100.883163|12.953860,100.887932|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589|12.951778,100.884003|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191&signature=hmGF5GWonfo2q9pJPNxqdsnMKlI="

Adelle007 wrote a review Feb 2010,50,Different and enjoyable,"My folks come out here every Christmas and New Year and I am starting to come out every other year to celebrate with them. The resort is broken up into parts I have stayed in part 3 and this year part 4.    Pt 3 from 2 yrs ago: This is very cheap accommodation and very conveniently located to get to the beach. The facilities are basic but exactly what you really want, rooms are nice and clean, you have a patio area to relax and then you have a communal pool to relax in aswell. This is a little dated, but I liked the small houses you stay in and the staff couldn't be nicer. I wouldn't call this luxury but it was exactly what was needed and no more.    Pt 4 this year, this is the brand new area, and it is really nice. The bathrooms have baths, you can tell they really tried to make this a nice place to stay and over all I think it is. The rooms are huge and I would even say perhaps much bigger than needed. They have a large sink in the room itself by the kettle, we were not sure why but I found it useful. The pool was very nice and I was relaxing there a lot. The manageress of pt 4 is to be highly commended, she is kind, thoughtful and has a great sense of humour. She is very much in control of everything at the resort and I don't think I have ever seen anyone work harder. I got flowers on my bed which smelt wonderful and I think that was just he maids being really nice to us. Breakfast was included in the room rate which it wasn't for pt 3, was basic but nice. (good bacon)    Over all pt 3 and pt 4, from a personal point of view, pt 4 is a lot more expensive than pt 3 and pt 3 had everything I wanted. I enjoy staying at the East Sea a lot, people are friendly, helpful and the rooms are really clean. It can be a bit noisy as there are a lot of Europeans coming here on holiday to enjoy the cheap night life (this is part of Pattaya not this area) Still didn't have any trouble with them and in gen they are all a good sport. Anyway I dare say the management can handle them! My partner and I wouldn't normally choose to come to Pattaya on holiday, he is T total and we are quite quiet people really. Oddly this place is really growing on me, people are friendly and a good laugh, food is good and a cold singha beer never hard to track down. If your looking for a place where you can have a break from 24hr partying then this is it, a small haven away from the madding crowd on your door step!","EAST SEA RESORT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.953861,100.886101&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.953861,100.886101&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.951410,100.887962|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.951634,100.887924|12.956288,100.889046|12.952541,100.888657|12.951286,100.887779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.954279,100.883163|12.953860,100.887932|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589|12.951778,100.884003|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191&signature=hmGF5GWonfo2q9pJPNxqdsnMKlI="

MikeyIdea wrote a review Feb 2016,10,Run down and old with bungalows smelling mould for way too high price,"I am very disappointed. The place is old and run down. The pillows in the bungalow smelled strongly of mould making the whole bungalow smell and even worse:    There are lots of broken tiles in the swimming pools, my daughter cut herself on one broken tile and came bleeding to me. I politely complained at the reception showing them my daughters cut hand and the blood but they did not care and the older lady there actually even turned her back and walked away from me and my daughter when I was not willing to accept her ignorance of what had happened    I found the behaviour unacceptable and requested to escalate to the owner (which I heard was a German) but the “Thai Resort Management” I was allowed to talk to was certainly not management and no different. The attitude, although not the exact words I got was: If you don’t like it here go somewhere else, not accepting to refund the money I already had paid in advance    I requested to have the mould coloured smelly pillows replaced and was refused, I brought them to the reception to let the staff smell them and look at the discolouring and was refused again. I ended up buying new pillows at Big C that we used for the week I was there as I was refused refund and couldn’t really afford to pay for a second place too for my family    I have stayed at East Sea Resort once in the past, about 10 years ago, and I was surprised and disappointed with how the place obviously has not been maintained, how run down it is now, and the behaviour of the staff. Bungalows are 1200 baht and 1800 baht (end of 2015) and there are many places in Pattaya Na Klua that offer a much better experience for that price.    The resort restaurant prices are at the high end and service was slow. There is another place just down the road that offer buffet breakfast and better food for much lower prices, check it out    The nature around the swimming pools is nice and that is the only thing East Sea Resort has to offer really.

Tegian wrote a review Dec 2015,20,Poor value,"Stayed in a worn down bungalow close to one of their pools, holes in a bridge, broken tiles all over area, this resort really really needs an update. Food/drink prizes high and they were understaffed (With Thai standards). All that being said the pools are nice if old an atleast our pool had a pool bar, another plus is the location easy to find not far off beach road and there are some bars and resturants close by.    Not worth the 1 800 bath we paid, there are many better places around in Pattaya for that price but not a total disaster for a night or two.","EAST SEA RESORT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.953861,100.886101&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.953861,100.886101&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.951410,100.887962|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.951634,100.887924|12.956288,100.889046|12.952541,100.888657|12.951286,100.887779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.954279,100.883163|12.953860,100.887932|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589|12.951778,100.884003|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191&signature=hmGF5GWonfo2q9pJPNxqdsnMKlI="
eric312659 wrote a review Apr 2015,20,Very disappointing....,"Having used East Sea yearly on eight or nine other occasions as our golf tour base,this time around it was extremly disappointing.  We should have seen it coming as, we mentioned between ourselves that nothing in the way of upgrading or maintenance had been evident over the years we had stayed there. Most of the efforts seems to have been directed at the new East Sea Paradise 4 wing.  East Sea 1 is tired, run down and in desperate need of a real spruce up.  The outside bar area although functioning during the day has been stripped and now closes at 8.00pm. This was our meeting point after golf and before going out in the evening. Hugely missed there is simply nothing else on offer to guests.  At TB1300.00 per day without breakfast it is ridiculously overpriced. There are many better hotels nearby offering much better value and I suggest you look for an alternative.  Speaking of our golf tour group and we have spent a great deal of money over the years this will definitely be our last visit. Sad to say that looking at managements attitude it will make little difference.","EAST SEA RESORT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.953861,100.886101&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.953861,100.886101&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.951410,100.887962|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.951634,100.887924|12.956288,100.889046|12.952541,100.888657|12.951286,100.887779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.954279,100.883163|12.953860,100.887932|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589|12.951778,100.884003|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191&signature=hmGF5GWonfo2q9pJPNxqdsnMKlI="

The service was really poor, from the reception to the restaurant/bar. No one looked happy and the service personnel did not make me feel welcomed at all.    The rooms were budget which is understandable considering the relatively low price compared to other hotels around. There were many mosquitoes in the whole hotel but it does not look like it was a concern for the management.

eric312659 wrote a review Mar 2013,30,not the Hilton but neither is the price!,"I have stayed here on a couple of occasions while on golf vacations.  Okay, its not 5 star but as a base if you are not over fussy about rhe fineries it is excellent value and in a good location in Norh Pattaya near Dolphin Circle.  Accomodation is chalet type with two ajoining apartments.    Bedrooms are O.K. and offer either double or two single beds. I found the mattresses hard but slept like a baby, so how bad can they be?  Adjoining toilet and shower area, has basic amenities and had adequate hot water for washing or showering. I visited a supermarket nearbye and stocked up on the usual shampoo and soap etc.  This is advisable as there is little on offer and it was not replenished daily.  The room had good air conditioning, mini bar and TV.    I did not eat in the restaurant, apart from a couple of breakfasts. From memory it was just O.K. but there are many eating establishments a short distance from the hotel to suit all tastes and pockets.  The swimming area is very nice and good for children and adults. Watch out for the suction outlets in the pool, they are extremely powerful and I brought this to managements attention as it could pose a real danger for children.    I found the staff all round to be exceptionally helpful and friendly, esecially Bo and her sister who look after the bar and coffee area.    Summing up a decent little place to stay, basic and not pretentious. Far enough away from the madness of downtown Pattaya it is very easy and cheap to get around.    Recommended if you are not expecting anything other than adequate accomodation.","EAST SEA RESORT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.953861,100.886101&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.953861,100.886101&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.951410,100.887962|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.951634,100.887924|12.956288,100.889046|12.952541,100.888657|12.951286,100.887779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.954279,100.883163|12.953860,100.887932|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589|12.951778,100.884003|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191&signature=hmGF5GWonfo2q9pJPNxqdsnMKlI="

Noksukou wrote a review Oct 2010,10,dont stay there,"booked part 3 got part 1 got now refound , Rooms are dirty , Bathroom is a disaster the Service is very poor ! Food tast like dogpo but you have to pay like it is Caviar  For the Price you can find much better Hotels or Resorts in Pattaya !!!  The Manager (Woman and Thai/Chinese mix ) is very unfriendly and as you can see the Resort is never fullbooked so it means she does a bad job .    stay away from the hotel or at least dont book the hotel over the own webpage ...take Thailandhotes etc . so you can change or canzel the Hotel if you not happy or get something you dont booked    Pools are all pretty nice ... thats the only pluspoint for his hotel from me","EAST SEA RESORT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.953861,100.886101&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.953861,100.886101&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.951410,100.887962|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.951634,100.887924|12.956288,100.889046|12.952541,100.888657|12.951286,100.887779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.954279,100.883163|12.953860,100.887932|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589|12.951778,100.884003|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191&signature=hmGF5GWonfo2q9pJPNxqdsnMKlI="
Adelle007 wrote a review Feb 2010,50,Different and enjoyable,"My folks come out here every Christmas and New Year and I am starting to come out every other year to celebrate with them. The resort is broken up into parts I have stayed in part 3 and this year part 4.    Pt 3 from 2 yrs ago: This is very cheap accommodation and very conveniently located to get to the beach. The facilities are basic but exactly what you really want, rooms are nice and clean, you have a patio area to relax and then you have a communal pool to relax in aswell. This is a little dated, but I liked the small houses you stay in and the staff couldn't be nicer. I wouldn't call this luxury but it was exactly what was needed and no more.    Pt 4 this year, this is the brand new area, and it is really nice. The bathrooms have baths, you can tell they really tried to make this a nice place to stay and over all I think it is. The rooms are huge and I would even say perhaps much bigger than needed. They have a large sink in the room itself by the kettle, we were not sure why but I found it useful. The pool was very nice and I was relaxing there a lot. The manageress of pt 4 is to be highly commended, she is kind, thoughtful and has a great sense of humour. She is very much in control of everything at the resort and I don't think I have ever seen anyone work harder. I got flowers on my bed which smelt wonderful and I think that was just he maids being really nice to us. Breakfast was included in the room rate which it wasn't for pt 3, was basic but nice. (good bacon)    Over all pt 3 and pt 4, from a personal point of view, pt 4 is a lot more expensive than pt 3 and pt 3 had everything I wanted. I enjoy staying at the East Sea a lot, people are friendly, helpful and the rooms are really clean. It can be a bit noisy as there are a lot of Europeans coming here on holiday to enjoy the cheap night life (this is part of Pattaya not this area) Still didn't have any trouble with them and in gen they are all a good sport. Anyway I dare say the management can handle them! My partner and I wouldn't normally choose to come to Pattaya on holiday, he is T total and we are quite quiet people really. Oddly this place is really growing on me, people are friendly and a good laugh, food is good and a cold singha beer never hard to track down. If your looking for a place where you can have a break from 24hr partying then this is it, a small haven away from the madding crowd on your door step!","EAST SEA RESORT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.953861,100.886101&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.953861,100.886101&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.951410,100.887962|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.951634,100.887924|12.956288,100.889046|12.952541,100.888657|12.951286,100.887779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.954279,100.883163|12.953860,100.887932|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589|12.951778,100.884003|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191&signature=hmGF5GWonfo2q9pJPNxqdsnMKlI="
