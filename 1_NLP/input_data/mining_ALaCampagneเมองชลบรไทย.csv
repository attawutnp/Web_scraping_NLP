"Idyllic, lovely place with healthy, tasty food",เม.ย. ค.ศ. 2021,"A’ la Campagne looks like a small, idyllic village. Despite being on the Sukhumvitroad, you will experience an oasis of peace. There are a good Thai (SomTum Villa) and a Western (La Rouge) restaurant, a few tastefully decorated bars, idyllic terraces, a tea factory, a shop selling homemade items, a naturally decorated playground, an inspiring farm and vegetable garden and a beautiful flower garden with fontains. It is all set up with love, attention and taste by Thais who enjoy the good and healthy life.

They have put a lot of effort into healthy organic food and drinks. Fresh smoothies, kombucha, salads, a wide selection of tea, fish. Most of the ingrediënten are organically produced and come from their own garden and farm. Being at A’ la Campagne feels like staying in the countryside. Fresh air, green and inspiring surroundings, good and healthy food, passsionate and loving people.",ALaCampagneเมองชลบรไทย,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.attraction_review&zoom=12&size=416x722&scale=2&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=th_TH&center=12.859625,100.908714&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-standard.png|scale:2|12.871229,100.901932|12.873680,100.943329|12.864644,100.940231|12.869840,100.890587&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-active-anchor.png|scale:2|12.859625,100.908714&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Frestaurants-standard.png|scale:2|12.859639,100.908714|12.860526,100.907852|12.859290,100.908791|12.862454,100.912453|12.851604,100.900131&map_id=c01884c8146ad115&signature=7y6qyVkeO_TR5CnYsUdsqrl4lyg="
Saturated with that Lovely European Vibe,พ.ค. ค.ศ. 2020,"The place is like a country village teleported from some European region, minus the cool weather. Interestingly, among all the cottage scheme of things, one of the eating houses was called Somtam Villa. Does not sound like you are going to get any authentic Thai food here but boy, was I wrong. The papaya salad with fermented fish, it has the raw savageness of Isan so genuine in every way. That giant pizza like krill fritter (not something you find in restaurants normally), it tasted just like true market fair. Fried pork belly in the so signature Thai fish sauce… . ahhh.. . the crackling of the tasty skin I miss now.

I was quite surprised when I arrived at the parking lot. A few times we tried to come here, and the place was packed too crowded. We did not manage to enter. Covid is 2 sides of the same coin. Thanks to it, the place had only a few visitors as lockdown was only recently lifted. In a selfish way, I was glad. People visit here not only for the food, but for strolling her ornamented gardens and a farmstead behind. They have huge horses that were curious to our presence. They came towards the perimeter as we approached. That meant selfie time. A cordoned off area called the Hen House, they have free-range chickens in there. They were all in their coop with a few strays doing their real free-range thingy. To add to the list of features, there is a playground where I let my kid free-ranged.

A glasshouse called Tea Factory is within this compound. There were pretty people in pretty dresses have their pretty desserts and pretty coffee concoctions. And as Thai ritual goes, everyone was religiously taking pictures of their colorful beverages and posting to Instagram. I had my good hot Americano here. Tea Factory was crowded compared to Somtam Villa where we had our quiet lunch. There are many things to do here and I can see why it was always crowded on holidays and weekends. The coffee was standard, the cake my kid had was run of the mill. But I am impressed with the lunch I had and the European village vibes just saturating the place.",ALaCampagneเมองชลบรไทย,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.attraction_review&zoom=12&size=416x722&scale=2&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=th_TH&center=12.859625,100.908714&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-standard.png|scale:2|12.871229,100.901932|12.873680,100.943329|12.864644,100.940231|12.869840,100.890587&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-active-anchor.png|scale:2|12.859625,100.908714&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Frestaurants-standard.png|scale:2|12.859639,100.908714|12.860526,100.907852|12.859290,100.908791|12.862454,100.912453|12.851604,100.900131&map_id=c01884c8146ad115&signature=7y6qyVkeO_TR5CnYsUdsqrl4lyg="
Not friendly too commercialized,มิ.ย. ค.ศ. 2020 • คู่รัก,I visited couple of times after post COVID-19 opening in June. They mention that Government policy each customer can spend 2 hours maximum. Really is there such policy? No other restaurant in Pattaya or even in Thailand has such policy. They do not maintain social distancing for seating. It is not a pleasant at there. Poor management.
