isnakebite wrote a review Sep 2019,40,It needed a few tweaks for a decent room at a decent price.,"This was my first ever visit, just needed the one night and it wont be the last visit. I feel it necessary to put some old reviews to bed.  Agoda prices are different to walk in prices because Agoda offer an online service, Agoda also take a cut and Agoda also don't pay the establishment till later. Ergo if you want to use Agoda's price then use Agoda.  The area is safe as anywhere at night, A short walk (left as you walk out) and then right you are on the main road for Tuk com, beach road (with turning a for 2nd road and Soi Bukhao). Across the road is a 7/11 and several restaurants as well as a restaurant to the immediate right.  The reception staff were polite, limited English it sufficient enough to greet you with a welcoming smile and make a joke.  My room was booked through agoda and for the price I was very happy, big room, 2 balconies one with table and chairs. Bed was comfy, the room was clean as was reception.  The only flaws were in the bathroom but nothing too drastic. The hairdryer supplied didn't work, the toilet seat had actually come away from the toilet, the shower doors didn't close properly and the shower unit head itself was different to the shower unit on the wall meaning it could not be operated hands free.  For the price you can't knock it and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.","CHAPLIN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.924583,100.883057&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.924583,100.883057&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.927390,100.883560|12.925632,100.883415|12.924911,100.885117|12.924070,100.880814|12.924639,100.879662|12.925678,100.881332|12.925760,100.885078|12.927651,100.883751|12.928725,100.881889&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923672,100.882370|12.925162,100.883400|12.924907,100.883331|12.924564,100.880341|12.927831,100.883133|12.927550,100.883583|12.928528,100.883720|12.927030,100.886185|12.925317,100.880257&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.927748,100.883247|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294|12.925020,100.884567|12.928134,100.881966|12.926652,100.882309|12.928206,100.881882&signature=PoZU_UFNYeoSPkXxlif8X2UfQYk="

Billie P wrote a review Jul 2017,10,"Awful ""service"" rude staff !!!!","HUGELY UNPROFESSIONAL. Really bad experience from start to finish. Stayed 7 nights total - from the off the receptionist insisted we pay 800 baht for a 600 baht room, and only backed down when we were firm that we knew the price. They then asked us to pay for the nights we'd stayed a few days in, and again tried charging 800 a night despite it being confirmed we were paying 600. We had constant calls waking us up insisting we had to check out, when we'd been very clear on the date we were leaving.    The wifi stopped working pretty early - we had to book tickets to the next country and visas within this timeframe, and not ONCE were we given even a simple apology (this applied to every issue we had) or offered a solution. After 3 days with no wifi and on the last day we could sort our visas, we came up with our own solution; again staff were completely unbothered.    Upon checking out, willing to pay full price despite the lack of advertised services, we were told we had to pay 1000 baht for a small makeup stain on the sheet and shown a photo. We explained it easily washed out, but they insisted we must buy a new sheet. When we argued with this, they brought the sheet down, which had a pen stain - completely different to the photo and FULL of holes. Stain or no stain, it needed throwing out. During this whole ordeal a member of staff came down and SCREAMED at us, causing a shouting match, then shouted about us to the other member of staff in Thai while glaring at us. They even threatened to call the police. I've never experienced this level of unprofessionalism. Scammer central - would not recommend to my worst enemy. Air con and occasionally working wifi might be ok for a quick stay but there are so many better options around that we wish we took. On the plus side they ordered us a McDonald's","CHAPLIN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.924583,100.883057&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.924583,100.883057&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.927390,100.883560|12.925632,100.883415|12.924911,100.885117|12.924070,100.880814|12.924639,100.879662|12.925678,100.881332|12.925760,100.885078|12.927651,100.883751|12.928725,100.881889&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923672,100.882370|12.925162,100.883400|12.924907,100.883331|12.924564,100.880341|12.927831,100.883133|12.927550,100.883583|12.928528,100.883720|12.927030,100.886185|12.925317,100.880257&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.927748,100.883247|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294|12.925020,100.884567|12.928134,100.881966|12.926652,100.882309|12.928206,100.881882&signature=PoZU_UFNYeoSPkXxlif8X2UfQYk="
Savannah B wrote a review Jul 2017,10,Stay away!!!!

The rooms were ok, but 600 a night is still very steep for the 'service' we received. We didn't have wifi for 3 of our nights, despite explaining to the reception staff that we needed the internet to book visas and flights etc. We received no apology, no explanation and no attempt to come up with a resolution. We had to ask ourselves if we could be moved to a floor that had wifi. Upon checking out, they tried to charge us 1000 baht for a 'stain' on the bed sheet that was not us, and when we contested it they threatened calling the police. We refused to pay for the stain, and then one of the housekeeping ladies came down and was especially rude. Still, after everything, no apology and no explanation. We left feeling like worthless customers and disappointed that we'd spent so much money there.

So were any traces of food or coffee, and it was a bit of a walk to get some. A problem, since, especially at night, I did not feel safe walking in the area. My shower was a treat! The only hot water came from the middle, hand-held spigot...there was an overhead ""rain"" shower head, but it only provided cold water, as did the lower sink-type faucet. Not a problem, really, but the hand-held faucet could only be hand held...there was no bracket to attach it to. The shower floor was installed slanted, so the drain did not work...all the water leaked out onto the bathroom floor, which meant I couldn't brush my teeth, etc. on a dry floor. I did mention this to staff, who said they would help, but they did not. My room was not cleaned every day, although they did leave water and tissue outside the door. Overall, it's just not a well-thought-out property. For the price, you can get much better in Pattaya.","CHAPLIN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.924583,100.883057&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.924583,100.883057&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.927390,100.883560|12.925632,100.883415|12.924911,100.885117|12.924070,100.880814|12.924639,100.879662|12.925678,100.881332|12.925760,100.885078|12.927651,100.883751|12.928725,100.881889&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923672,100.882370|12.925162,100.883400|12.924907,100.883331|12.924564,100.880341|12.927831,100.883133|12.927550,100.883583|12.928528,100.883720|12.927030,100.886185|12.925317,100.880257&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.927748,100.883247|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294|12.925020,100.884567|12.928134,100.881966|12.926652,100.882309|12.928206,100.881882&signature=PoZU_UFNYeoSPkXxlif8X2UfQYk="

isnakebite wrote a review Sep 2019,40,It needed a few tweaks for a decent room at a decent price.,"This was my first ever visit, just needed the one night and it wont be the last visit. I feel it necessary to put some old reviews to bed.  Agoda prices are different to walk in prices because Agoda offer an online service, Agoda also take a cut and Agoda also don't pay the establishment till later. Ergo if you want to use Agoda's price then use Agoda.  The area is safe as anywhere at night, A short walk (left as you walk out) and then right you are on the main road for Tuk com, beach road (with turning a for 2nd road and Soi Bukhao). Across the road is a 7/11 and several restaurants as well as a restaurant to the immediate right.  The reception staff were polite, limited English it sufficient enough to greet you with a welcoming smile and make a joke.  My room was booked through agoda and for the price I was very happy, big room, 2 balconies one with table and chairs. Bed was comfy, the room was clean as was reception.  The only flaws were in the bathroom but nothing too drastic. The hairdryer supplied didn't work, the toilet seat had actually come away from the toilet, the shower doors didn't close properly and the shower unit head itself was different to the shower unit on the wall meaning it could not be operated hands free.  For the price you can't knock it and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.","CHAPLIN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.924583,100.883057&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.924583,100.883057&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.927390,100.883560|12.925632,100.883415|12.924911,100.885117|12.924070,100.880814|12.924639,100.879662|12.925678,100.881332|12.925760,100.885078|12.927651,100.883751|12.928725,100.881889&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923672,100.882370|12.925162,100.883400|12.924907,100.883331|12.924564,100.880341|12.927831,100.883133|12.927550,100.883583|12.928528,100.883720|12.927030,100.886185|12.925317,100.880257&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.927748,100.883247|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294|12.925020,100.884567|12.928134,100.881966|12.926652,100.882309|12.928206,100.881882&signature=PoZU_UFNYeoSPkXxlif8X2UfQYk="

Billie P wrote a review Jul 2017,10,"Awful ""service"" rude staff !!!!","HUGELY UNPROFESSIONAL. Really bad experience from start to finish. Stayed 7 nights total - from the off the receptionist insisted we pay 800 baht for a 600 baht room, and only backed down when we were firm that we knew the price. They then asked us to pay for the nights we'd stayed a few days in, and again tried charging 800 a night despite it being confirmed we were paying 600. We had constant calls waking us up insisting we had to check out, when we'd been very clear on the date we were leaving.    The wifi stopped working pretty early - we had to book tickets to the next country and visas within this timeframe, and not ONCE were we given even a simple apology (this applied to every issue we had) or offered a solution. After 3 days with no wifi and on the last day we could sort our visas, we came up with our own solution; again staff were completely unbothered.    Upon checking out, willing to pay full price despite the lack of advertised services, we were told we had to pay 1000 baht for a small makeup stain on the sheet and shown a photo. We explained it easily washed out, but they insisted we must buy a new sheet. When we argued with this, they brought the sheet down, which had a pen stain - completely different to the photo and FULL of holes. Stain or no stain, it needed throwing out. During this whole ordeal a member of staff came down and SCREAMED at us, causing a shouting match, then shouted about us to the other member of staff in Thai while glaring at us. They even threatened to call the police. I've never experienced this level of unprofessionalism. Scammer central - would not recommend to my worst enemy. Air con and occasionally working wifi might be ok for a quick stay but there are so many better options around that we wish we took.

Savannah B wrote a review Jul 2017,10,Stay away!!!! Scammers!!!,"Right from the offset, the woman in reception tried charging us 800 baht a night even though we'd seen a fixed price on booking.com for 600 a night. The rooms were ok, but 600 a night is still very steep for the 'service' we received. We didn't have wifi for 3 of our nights, despite explaining to the reception staff that we needed the internet to book visas and flights etc. We received no apology, no explanation and no attempt to come up with a resolution. We had to ask ourselves if we could be moved to a floor that had wifi. Upon checking out, they tried to charge us 1000 baht for a 'stain' on the bed sheet that was not us, and when we contested it they threatened calling the police. We refused to pay for the stain, and then one of the housekeeping ladies came down and was especially rude. Still, after everything, no apology and no explanation. We left feeling like worthless customers and disappointed that we'd spent so much money there.

Doug Horspool wrote a review Jan 2017,20,I won't stay here again.,"Wifi is important for me...in my room, it was nonexistent. So were any traces of food or coffee, and it was a bit of a walk to get some. A problem, since, especially at night, I did not feel safe walking in the area. My shower was a treat! The only hot water came from the middle, hand-held spigot...there was an overhead ""rain"" shower head, but it only provided cold water, as did the lower sink-type faucet. Not a problem, really, but the hand-held faucet could only be hand held...there was no bracket to attach it to. The shower floor was installed slanted, so the drain did not work...all the water leaked out onto the bathroom floor, which meant I couldn't brush my teeth, etc. on a dry floor. I did mention this to staff, who said they would help, but they did not. My room was not cleaned every day, although they did leave water and tissue outside the door. Overall, it's just not a well-thought-out property. For the price, you can get much better in Pattaya.","CHAPLIN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.924583,100.883057&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.924583,100.883057&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.927390,100.883560|12.925632,100.883415|12.924911,100.885117|12.924070,100.880814|12.924639,100.879662|12.925678,100.881332|12.925760,100.885078|12.927651,100.883751|12.928725,100.881889&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923672,100.882370|12.925162,100.883400|12.924907,100.883331|12.924564,100.880341|12.927831,100.883133|12.927550,100.883583|12.928528,100.883720|12.927030,100.886185|12.925317,100.880257&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.927748,100.883247|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294|12.925020,100.884567|12.928134,100.881966|12.926652,100.882309|12.928206,100.881882&signature=PoZU_UFNYeoSPkXxlif8X2UfQYk="
