Alic796 wrote a review Apr 2018,20,Dissapointed,After such great reviews for this place we were so dissapointed. After a 7 hour bus journey we arrived to be rudely spoken to by the owner because we did not reply to him that day when he messaged me asking what time I would arrive. Well thats because i was on a bus with no wifi. Then to be told we had to stay at his family hotel as when booking threw booking.com this dose not confirm your booking however booking.com says it dose. I have never had this issue anywhere else in the world. The hotel he took us to was ok but not what we had wanted from our time in pattaya. Also which was kind the owner said he would collect us at 12noon on our departure date and take us to the bus. However by 12.20 on that day he still never showed up until i messaged him. He did get us to the bus just with 5 mins to spare. I wouldnt reccomend if you get put else where and i cant comment on this place as we never stayed.,A & M VILLA PATTAYA - Hotel Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.946337,100.898590&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.946337,100.898590|12.946337,100.898590&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.948774,100.901779|12.947065,100.902237|12.949550,100.900642|12.945667,100.895203&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.944869,100.895897|12.945342,100.895866|12.949677,100.899323|12.949930,100.896667|12.946274,100.898720|12.946539,100.902290|12.943967,100.895470|12.946539,100.902290|12.946539,100.902290&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.947595,100.896782|12.949136,100.897072|12.949854,100.897247|12.948847,100.896042|12.949411,100.896698|12.949163,100.897537|12.949303,100.900528|12.950200,100.897591&signature=ysKqqfS720XB2zztbwKCoNAYrJ0="
Yogiwanders wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Pleasant Stay,"Very clean. Excellent location. Friendly owners. We booked two rooms top floor, one with the bath tub and another without, for our 4D3N stay in Pattaya. The room was surprisingly big; bed was good but could be better; A/C was cold enough; working flatscreen tv; clean utensils, working fridge, free instant coffee, working microwave, and free bottled water everyday; jacuzzi, bathtub and shower was good, we didn't mind about not having much hot water since it's very hot out anyway. They also have vaults in the room which is a plus. For it's price, you'd be surprise because you will get more than what you pay. Coming back from a tiring trip around Pattaya or just staying in, you'll definitely love every second of your stay here.

We searched from internet and found this place, but we didn't book it through internet. Finally when we arrived there, they told us that they have only one free room left, and it is expensive. Quickly I opened my phone and made a booking online with much cheaper price! And we ended up getting an amazing room for 600baht per two people. We had even a small kitchen! Room was nice on the highest floor with aircon and fan! Also next to our room was a tiny 'pool' with sunbathing chairs. Nothing fancy but really cute! Also our room was cleaned even on our last day before the check out, we just went to 7/11 for 15 minutes, when we came back we had new towels and the bed was made up!  Actually at the beginning we booked it only for one night, but we ended up staying for two, first the wanted us to change room for the second night as well as to pay more, but luckily everything stayed same for the second night!  It is a bit far from city centre, and food on a road next to it is not really good, but it was good place to go after walking street and rest!    PS! Since I am Estonian, there is Estonian liqueur store close to this villa, go and try some 'Vana Tallinn' in Asia! :)    Would definitely go again!",A & M VILLA PATTAYA - Hotel Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.946337,100.898590&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.946337,100.898590|12.946337,100.898590&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.948774,100.901779|12.947065,100.902237|12.949550,100.900642|12.945667,100.895203&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.944869,100.895897|12.945342,100.895866|12.949677,100.899323|12.949930,100.896667|12.946274,100.898720|12.946539,100.902290|12.943967,100.895470|12.946539,100.902290|12.946539,100.902290&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.947595,100.896782|12.949136,100.897072|12.949854,100.897247|12.948847,100.896042|12.949411,100.896698|12.949163,100.897537|12.949303,100.900528|12.950200,100.897591&signature=ysKqqfS720XB2zztbwKCoNAYrJ0="
Came0024 wrote a review Jan 2016,40,Good value for money,"We had a pleasant stay there and spent some good night of sleep. The room was huge, like a little flat, with a kitchen. Some tea and coffee, but not kettle though ? So actually useless.  The bathroom was nice, but a bit dirty, and the boiler was broken, so we had to take cold showers. Not a big deal, but it was supposed to be included in the price of the room.  We are still looking for the private swimming pool as well..  The staff was not very friendly, barely speaking English, or totally invisible, except the last day where we met the manager (we guess) who was quite nice.  I give it a good score despite of all this because we had a good time there, watching movies and relaxing, the bed was huge and confortable, and it was for us, well located, near lots of supermarkets, and a bit away from the centre, full of noise and prostitution.",A & M VILLA PATTAYA - Hotel Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.946337,100.898590&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.946337,100.898590|12.946337,100.898590&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.948774,100.901779|12.947065,100.902237|12.949550,100.900642|12.945667,100.895203&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.944869,100.895897|12.945342,100.895866|12.949677,100.899323|12.949930,100.896667|12.946274,100.898720|12.946539,100.902290|12.943967,100.895470|12.946539,100.902290|12.946539,100.902290&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.947595,100.896782|12.949136,100.897072|12.949854,100.897247|12.948847,100.896042|12.949411,100.896698|12.949163,100.897537|12.949303,100.900528|12.950200,100.897591&signature=ysKqqfS720XB2zztbwKCoNAYrJ0="
RRay84 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Highly recommended!!,"Very close to the bus station (though we were ripped off by the baht taxi driver), and located near many restaurant and departmental stores. We walked to the beach (~20 mins) and Alcazar (~15 mins).  Owner is very helpful; we even got our luggage hauled up to the studio!  We had the deluxe king studio on the 2nd floor, which, for 490 baht, was an absolute bargain, keeping in mind the steep prices in Pattaya.  Our studio had a double bed, 2 bedside tables, a wardrobe with a safe inside, 2 sofas and a coffee table, and also a set of shelves.  It also had a refrigerator, an electric kettle (didn't work, but we didn't use this), plates, cups, glasses and a steel sink.  The bathroom has everything from toothbrush-toothpaste sets to other toiletries. True, the toilet paper wasnt folded to a triangle, but who cares anyway! A hand towel and bath towel each were also provided, as were slippers.  There were lounge chairs and sunbeds on the terrace outside, as well as a whirlpool! There is also another terrace on the 1st floor.  Ample plug points, great wifi and a sound night's sleep!  Free bottles of water were provided, and the owner let us check out late at 21:15 instead of 12:00!

Alic796 wrote a review Apr 2018,20,Dissapointed,After such great reviews for this place we were so dissapointed. After a 7 hour bus journey we arrived to be rudely spoken to by the owner because we did not reply to him that day when he messaged me asking what time I would arrive. Well thats because i was on a bus with no wifi. Then to be told we had to stay at his family hotel as when booking threw booking.com this dose not confirm your booking however booking.com says it dose. I have never had this issue anywhere else in the world. The hotel he took us to was ok but not what we had wanted from our time in pattaya. Also which was kind the owner said he would collect us at 12noon on our departure date and take us to the bus. However by 12.20 on that day he still never showed up until i messaged him. He did get us to the bus just with 5 mins to spare. I wouldnt reccomend if you get put else where and i cant comment on this place as we never stayed.,A & M VILLA PATTAYA - Hotel Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.946337,100.898590&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.946337,100.898590|12.946337,100.898590&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.948774,100.901779|12.947065,100.902237|12.949550,100.900642|12.945667,100.895203&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.944869,100.895897|12.945342,100.895866|12.949677,100.899323|12.949930,100.896667|12.946274,100.898720|12.946539,100.902290|12.943967,100.895470|12.946539,100.902290|12.946539,100.902290&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.947595,100.896782|12.949854,100.897247|12.949136,100.897072|12.948847,100.896042|12.949411,100.896698|12.949163,100.897537|12.949303,100.900528|12.950200,100.897591&signature=tFfmcvYh_FMl8CZdlFtb7yY42JM="
Yogiwanders wrote a review Apr 2018,40,Pleasant Stay,"Very clean. Excellent location. Friendly owners. We booked two rooms top floor, one with the bath tub and another without, for our 4D3N stay in Pattaya. The room was surprisingly big; bed was good but could be better; A/C was cold enough; working flatscreen tv; clean utensils, working fridge, free instant coffee, working microwave, and free bottled water everyday; jacuzzi, bathtub and shower was good, we didn't mind about not having much hot water since it's very hot out anyway. They also have vaults in the room which is a plus. For it's price, you'd be surprise because you will get more than what you pay.

Be a traveler not a tourist wrote a review Apr 2016,30,Okay for a quick stopover but not exactly clean..,"The room is huge but dated. The kitchenette cabinates are well worn. The stone bathroom feels damp with water leaking around the toilet. Our room was right off reception so we were woken up by people listening to TV & from outsode the window. Its a qiet setting just a shame about the amount of unnecessarty internal noise.

Johannariinu wrote a review Mar 2016,30,Amazing deal!,"My cousin came to visit me and we got a spontaneous idea to go to Pattaya, after few hours we arrived. We searched from internet and found this place, but we didn't book it through internet. Finally when we arrived there, they told us that they have only one free room left, and it is expensive. Quickly I opened my phone and made a booking online with much cheaper price! And we ended up getting an amazing room for 600baht per two people. We had even a small kitchen! Room was nice on the highest floor with aircon and fan! Also next to our room was a tiny 'pool' with sunbathing chairs. Nothing fancy but really cute! Also our room was cleaned even on our last day before the check out, we just went to 7/11 for 15 minutes, when we came back we had new towels and the bed was made up!  Actually at the beginning we booked it only for one night, but we ended up staying for two, first the wanted us to change room for the second night as well as to pay more, but luckily everything stayed same for the second night!  It is a bit far from city centre, and food on a road next to it is not really good, but it was good place to go after walking street and rest!    PS! Since I am Estonian, there is Estonian liqueur store close to this villa, go and try some 'Vana Tallinn' in Asia! :)    Would definitely go again!",A & M VILLA PATTAYA - Hotel Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.946337,100.898590&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.946337,100.898590|12.946337,100.898590&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.948774,100.901779|12.947065,100.902237|12.949550,100.900642|12.945667,100.895203&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.944869,100.895897|12.945342,100.895866|12.949677,100.899323|12.949930,100.896667|12.946274,100.898720|12.946539,100.902290|12.943967,100.895470|12.946539,100.902290|12.946539,100.902290&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.947595,100.896782|12.949854,100.897247|12.949136,100.897072|12.948847,100.896042|12.949411,100.896698|12.949163,100.897537|12.949303,100.900528|12.950200,100.897591&signature=tFfmcvYh_FMl8CZdlFtb7yY42JM="
Came0024 wrote a review Jan 2016,40,Good value for money,"We had a pleasant stay there and spent some good night of sleep. The room was huge, like a little flat, with a kitchen. Some tea and coffee, but not kettle though ? So actually useless.  The bathroom was nice, but a bit dirty, and the boiler was broken, so we had to take cold showers. Not a big deal, but it was supposed to be included in the price of the room.  We are still looking for the private swimming pool as well..  The staff was not very friendly, barely speaking English, or totally invisible, except the last day where we met the manager (we guess) who was quite nice.  I give it a good score despite of all this because we had a good time there, watching movies and relaxing, the bed was huge and confortable, and it was for us, well located, near lots of supermarkets, and a bit away from the centre, full of noise and prostitution.",A & M VILLA PATTAYA - Hotel Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.946337,100.898590&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.946337,100.898590|12.946337,100.898590&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.948774,100.901779|12.947065,100.902237|12.949550,100.900642|12.945667,100.895203&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.944869,100.895897|12.945342,100.895866|12.949677,100.899323|12.949930,100.896667|12.946274,100.898720|12.946539,100.902290|12.943967,100.895470|12.946539,100.902290|12.946539,100.902290&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.947595,100.896782|12.949854,100.897247|12.949136,100.897072|12.948847,100.896042|12.949411,100.896698|12.949163,100.897537|12.949303,100.900528|12.950200,100.897591&signature=tFfmcvYh_FMl8CZdlFtb7yY42JM="
RRay84 wrote a review Oct 2015,50,Highly recommended!!,"Very close to the bus station (though we were ripped off by the baht taxi driver), and located near many restaurant and departmental stores. We walked to the beach (~20 mins) and Alcazar (~15 mins).  Owner is very helpful; we even got our luggage hauled up to the studio!  We had the deluxe king studio on the 2nd floor, which, for 490 baht, was an absolute bargain, keeping in mind the steep prices in Pattaya.  Our studio had a double bed, 2 bedside tables, a wardrobe with a safe inside, 2 sofas and a coffee table, and also a set of shelves.  It also had a refrigerator, an electric kettle (didn't work, but we didn't use this), plates, cups, glasses and a steel sink.  The bathroom has everything from toothbrush-toothpaste sets to other toiletries. True, the toilet paper wasnt folded to a triangle, but who cares anyway! A hand towel and bath towel each were also provided, as were slippers.  There were lounge chairs and sunbeds on the terrace outside, as well as a whirlpool! There is also another terrace on the 1st floor.  Ample plug points, great wifi and a sound night's sleep!  Free bottles of water were provided, and the owner let us check out late at 21:15 instead of 12:00!

The smell comes from the hole of the bathroom and the smell is very strong. You cant breath here everytime you use the bathroom. Its very Nasty!. I wish the owner can fixed this problem.    No Laundry service here.You have to go outside. To do your laundry . Its not that far they have everywhere.    The 3rd problem is, you have to walk way way far. As they dont have Bath Tuktuk.

Enrique F wrote a review Jun 2015,40,Great place to stay! but far if you want to walk around,"This hotel is very nice. Is quite comfortable, the room was very big and next to the jacuzzi on the rooftop. Is very far (if you want to walk everywhere) but is quite and no noise around if you just want to relax. The staff is very friendly and they even gave me a welcome drink!

Mayayaman wrote a review Apr 2015,40,Good place to stay with low price,Great place far away from noise but also close to Big C extra and main central road  A little dates but nice  Not much parking for cars but there is only 9 units in building  Someone is at reception 24 hours a day and feels fairly safe around area  Large size rooms with large bed  A few Mosquitos  No lift in building so 2 flights of stairs each time if you stay on 3rd floor  Jacuzzi on top but cold water  Negotiate with reception about price  Don't go through internet or you will pay double the price than ringing direct  A little hard to find first time but after that it's easy  Recommended place to stay,A & M VILLA PATTAYA - Hotel Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.946337,100.898590&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.946337,100.898590|12.946337,100.898590&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.948774,100.901779|12.947065,100.902237|12.949550,100.900642|12.945667,100.895203&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.944869,100.895897|12.945342,100.895866|12.949677,100.899323|12.949930,100.896667|12.946274,100.898720|12.946539,100.902290|12.943967,100.895470|12.946539,100.902290|12.946539,100.902290&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.947595,100.896782|12.949854,100.897247|12.949136,100.897072|12.948847,100.896042|12.949411,100.896698|12.949163,100.897537|12.949303,100.900528|12.950200,100.897591&signature=tFfmcvYh_FMl8CZdlFtb7yY42JM="
