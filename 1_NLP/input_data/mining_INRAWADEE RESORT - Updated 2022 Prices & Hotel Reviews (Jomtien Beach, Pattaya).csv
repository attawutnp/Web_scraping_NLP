Alan T wrote a review Sep 2014,20,A nearly place,"This resort looked to have everything we would need for out break. This for us included the fact that they allow pets. The resort itself is out of the way and a fair distance from the beach or centre. Accommodation is in wooden chalets in nice wooded grounds, there was a pool and a reception come restaurant / bar which basically hardly opened. This is why I titled this a nearly place, here is a resort, somewhat out of the way with some nice areas to eat and drink in but they are closed. You are forced to do it yourself (which we did one night cooking on the decking by our chalet) or go into town. As most restaurants in town don't like you taking dogs with you there were a number of unhappy dogs locked in chalets whilst their owners went out.  Could be good but poor.","INRAWADEE RESORT - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.877580,100.890259&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.877580,100.890259&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.869840,100.890587|12.871150,100.894218|12.881847,100.897491|12.879808,100.896843|12.884580,100.897720&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.879426,100.892242|12.881090,100.897530|12.874329,100.887398|12.880282,100.884209|12.879130,100.891273|12.868108,100.891670|12.877930,100.891289|12.881065,100.898087|12.881370,100.884338&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883314,100.896751|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.871732,100.889671|12.877643,100.885033&signature=8kVXlS4s6OT7GqsSZkxEr8BKmhY="

Dimitri L wrote a review Apr 2013,20,"Did stay only one night, will not go back","Ok, the staff is very nice and helpfull. They drive you to the beach if you want to.  But, the rooms are very very basic and small. All in wood, it makes a lot of sound when walking around. The door and windows does not close perfectly.  I booked for 5 nights but only managed to stay one night.  I felt so lonely and depressed.  There is nothing around. Just a long, small road with dogs, barking and following your tuktuk when arriving there.  The place is quite nice, but do not go there if you want to see a lot of people and do a lot of stuff. Go there if you like to be all alone on yourself.","INRAWADEE RESORT - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.877580,100.890259&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.877580,100.890259&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.869840,100.890587|12.871150,100.894218|12.881847,100.897491|12.879808,100.896843|12.884580,100.897720&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.879426,100.892242|12.881090,100.897530|12.874329,100.887398|12.880282,100.884209|12.879130,100.891273|12.868108,100.891670|12.877930,100.891289|12.881065,100.898087|12.881370,100.884338&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883314,100.896751|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.871732,100.889671|12.877643,100.885033&signature=8kVXlS4s6OT7GqsSZkxEr8BKmhY="

Well we first entered the room to see a dead cockroach, in the evening a live one crawled across the bed then disappeared. The next morning the biggest spider I've ever seen was in the shower. My pocket swiss army knife was stolen from the room and they ate lots of our cookies, unbelievable. At 2am someone tried to get in the room, my girlfriends screaming scared them off but only after a full minute of terrifying door rattling. If your life depends on it don't stay here!

LesleyDunn09 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,"Perfect , quiet location , friendly staff and a very cute dog !!","We stayed for 6 weeks at the resort , sometimes we were the only people there- it got busier at weekends. The bungalows are little wooden huts with aircon- but not in the bathroom. The shower was very good - plenty of water, The reception staff were very friendly. Thanks Jo ! The bungalow was serviced every day so you had fresh towels and clean sheets which was very welcome. The staff were very friendly - one family lived on site near the pool. We hired a motorbike while we were there but it is only a short walk to the main road then you can get a baht bus along the coast road to Pattaya for only 10 baht - great value and to get back the taxi bikes are great fun- you can haggle the price down. In the bungalow you have a safe - you set the code for it. There is a fridge for your drinks and food and we got a bowl from reception - so each morning we had ceral and friut on the veranda and at night - before we went out we had a few drinks- If you but the mossy curls from the 7 eleven shops they keep them at bay. There is a very cute dog we named maisey- she answer to anything really as she is Thai !! The pool was really nice- very clean but take care as you get in - there is a surpise - underfoot !! We will stay there again - Jo has some of our clothes- we ran out of space as we bought stuff to take back !! Apart from that it suited us down to the ground - bu we are very easy going and take everything in our stride - lifes to short to be hung up on stuff - If you want things like at home - stay at home . Thailand is a place to experience and enjoy and never judge- everyone has to survive and live somehow.

valschmitt wrote a review Feb 2011,30,Very far from the beach,"We stayed at Inrawadee resort for the week end. The rooms are very simple and basic (small huts) but decorated with a lot of taste. The bathrooms are very badly designed with no space between the water closet and the sink. We did not suffer from mosquitoes although there were holes in the wooden floor. We however slept like babies because the resort is located in a quiet & remote area.    The main problem was that the beach (Jomtien) was relatively far from the hotel (20 minutes walk) with no transportation organized by the hotel. When going to the beach we had to walk first on a small and dangerous road (no side walk) and then on a bigger street. On the way back we used to take local tuk-tuks (song tao) but they would stop at the intersection between the main street and the small road of the hotel, therefore we had to come back walking which is not only very pleasant after a whole day on the beach.","INRAWADEE RESORT - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.877580,100.890259&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.877580,100.890259&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.869840,100.890587|12.871150,100.894218|12.881847,100.897491|12.879808,100.896843|12.884580,100.897720&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.879426,100.892242|12.881090,100.897530|12.874329,100.887398|12.880282,100.884209|12.879130,100.891273|12.868108,100.891670|12.877930,100.891289|12.881065,100.898087|12.881370,100.884338&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883314,100.896751|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.871732,100.889671|12.877643,100.885033&signature=8kVXlS4s6OT7GqsSZkxEr8BKmhY="

Alan T wrote a review Sep 2014,20,A nearly place,"This resort looked to have everything we would need for out break. This for us included the fact that they allow pets. The resort itself is out of the way and a fair distance from the beach or centre. Accommodation is in wooden chalets in nice wooded grounds, there was a pool and a reception come restaurant / bar which basically hardly opened. This is why I titled this a nearly place, here is a resort, somewhat out of the way with some nice areas to eat and drink in but they are closed. You are forced to do it yourself (which we did one night cooking on the decking by our chalet) or go into town. As most restaurants in town don't like you taking dogs with you there were a number of unhappy dogs locked in chalets whilst their owners went out.  Could be good but poor.","INRAWADEE RESORT - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.877580,100.890259&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.877580,100.890259&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.869840,100.890587|12.871150,100.894218|12.881847,100.897491|12.879808,100.896843|12.884580,100.897720&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.879426,100.892242|12.881090,100.897530|12.874329,100.887398|12.880282,100.884209|12.879130,100.891273|12.868108,100.891670|12.877930,100.891289|12.881065,100.898087|12.881370,100.884338&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883314,100.896751|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.871732,100.889671|12.877643,100.885033&signature=8kVXlS4s6OT7GqsSZkxEr8BKmhY="

I booked for 5 nights but only managed to stay one night.  I felt so lonely and depressed.  There is nothing around. Just a long, small road with dogs, barking and following your tuktuk when arriving there.  The place is quite nice, but do not go there if you want to see a lot of people and do a lot of stuff. Go there if you like to be all alone on yourself.","INRAWADEE RESORT - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.877580,100.890259&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.877580,100.890259&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.869840,100.890587|12.871150,100.894218|12.881847,100.897491|12.879808,100.896843|12.884580,100.897720&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.879426,100.892242|12.881090,100.897530|12.874329,100.887398|12.880282,100.884209|12.879130,100.891273|12.868108,100.891670|12.877930,100.891289|12.881065,100.898087|12.881370,100.884338&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883314,100.896751|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.871732,100.889671|12.877643,100.885033&signature=8kVXlS4s6OT7GqsSZkxEr8BKmhY="

LesleyDunn09 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,"Perfect , quiet location , friendly staff and a very cute dog !!","We stayed for 6 weeks at the resort , sometimes we were the only people there- it got busier at weekends. The bungalows are little wooden huts with aircon- but not in the bathroom. The shower was very good - plenty of water, The reception staff were very friendly. Thanks Jo ! The bungalow was serviced every day so you had fresh towels and clean sheets which was very welcome. The staff were very friendly - one family lived on site near the pool. We hired a motorbike while we were there but it is only a short walk to the main road then you can get a baht bus along the coast road to Pattaya for only 10 baht - great value and to get back the taxi bikes are great fun- you can haggle the price down. In the bungalow you have a safe - you set the code for it. There is a fridge for your drinks and food and we got a bowl from reception - so each morning we had ceral and friut on the veranda and at night - before we went out we had a few drinks- If you but the mossy curls from the 7 eleven shops they keep them at bay. There is a very cute dog we named maisey- she answer to anything really as she is Thai !! The pool was really nice- very clean but take care as you get in - there is a surpise - underfoot !! We will stay there again - Jo has some of our clothes- we ran out of space as we bought stuff to take back !! Apart from that it suited us down to the ground - bu we are very easy going and take everything in our stride - lifes to short to be hung up on stuff - If you want things like at home - stay at home . Thailand is a place to experience and enjoy and never judge- everyone has to survive and live somehow.

valschmitt wrote a review Feb 2011,30,Very far from the beach,"We stayed at Inrawadee resort for the week end. The rooms are very simple and basic (small huts) but decorated with a lot of taste. The bathrooms are very badly designed with no space between the water closet and the sink. We did not suffer from mosquitoes although there were holes in the wooden floor. We however slept like babies because the resort is located in a quiet & remote area.    The main problem was that the beach (Jomtien) was relatively far from the hotel (20 minutes walk) with no transportation organized by the hotel. When going to the beach we had to walk first on a small and dangerous road (no side walk) and then on a bigger street. On the way back we used to take local tuk-tuks (song tao) but they would stop at the intersection between the main street and the small road of the hotel, therefore we had to come back walking which is not only very pleasant after a whole day on the beach.","INRAWADEE RESORT - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.877580,100.890259&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.877580,100.890259&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.869840,100.890587|12.871150,100.894218|12.881847,100.897491|12.879808,100.896843|12.884580,100.897720&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.879426,100.892242|12.881090,100.897530|12.874329,100.887398|12.880282,100.884209|12.879130,100.891273|12.868108,100.891670|12.877930,100.891289|12.881065,100.898087|12.881370,100.884338&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883314,100.896751|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.871732,100.889671|12.877643,100.885033&signature=8kVXlS4s6OT7GqsSZkxEr8BKmhY="

Alan T wrote a review Sep 2014,20,A nearly place,"This resort looked to have everything we would need for out break. This for us included the fact that they allow pets. The resort itself is out of the way and a fair distance from the beach or centre. Accommodation is in wooden chalets in nice wooded grounds, there was a pool and a reception come restaurant / bar which basically hardly opened. This is why I titled this a nearly place, here is a resort, somewhat out of the way with some nice areas to eat and drink in but they are closed. You are forced to do it yourself (which we did one night cooking on the decking by our chalet) or go into town. As most restaurants in town don't like you taking dogs with you there were a number of unhappy dogs locked in chalets whilst their owners went out.  Could be good but poor.","INRAWADEE RESORT - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.877580,100.890259&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.877580,100.890259&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.869840,100.890587|12.871150,100.894218|12.881847,100.897491|12.879808,100.896843|12.884580,100.897720&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.879426,100.892242|12.881090,100.897530|12.874329,100.887398|12.880282,100.884209|12.879130,100.891273|12.868108,100.891670|12.877930,100.891289|12.881065,100.898087|12.881370,100.884338&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883314,100.896751|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.871732,100.889671|12.877643,100.885033&signature=8kVXlS4s6OT7GqsSZkxEr8BKmhY="

Just a long, small road with dogs, barking and following your tuktuk when arriving there.  The place is quite nice, but do not go there if you want to see a lot of people and do a lot of stuff.

Wanderingsouls1 wrote a review Dec 2012,10,"Spiders, cockroaches. Theft from room. No English speaking staff, attempted 2am room break in. Worst place we've ever stayed.","Where to begin. Well we first entered the room to see a dead cockroach, in the evening a live one crawled across the bed then disappeared. The next morning the biggest spider I've ever seen was in the shower. My pocket swiss army knife was stolen from the room and they ate lots of our cookies, unbelievable. At 2am someone tried to get in the room, my girlfriends screaming scared them off but only after a full minute of terrifying door rattling. If your life depends on it don't stay here! Stay in the woods or on the beach, anywhere just not here. Really can't believe no one speaks a word of English either. Don't stay here!","INRAWADEE RESORT - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.877580,100.890259&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.877580,100.890259&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.869840,100.890587|12.871150,100.894218|12.881847,100.897491|12.879808,100.896843|12.884580,100.897720&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.879426,100.892242|12.881090,100.897530|12.874329,100.887398|12.880282,100.884209|12.879130,100.891273|12.868108,100.891670|12.877930,100.891289|12.881065,100.898087|12.881370,100.884338&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883314,100.896751|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.871732,100.889671|12.877643,100.885033&signature=8kVXlS4s6OT7GqsSZkxEr8BKmhY="
LesleyDunn09 wrote a review Mar 2012,50,"Perfect , quiet location , friendly staff and a very cute dog !!","We stayed for 6 weeks at the resort , sometimes we were the only people there- it got busier at weekends. The bungalows are little wooden huts with aircon- but not in the bathroom. The shower was very good - plenty of water, The reception staff were very friendly. Thanks Jo ! The bungalow was serviced every day so you had fresh towels and clean sheets which was very welcome. The staff were very friendly - one family lived on site near the pool. We hired a motorbike while we were there but it is only a short walk to the main road then you can get a baht bus along the coast road to Pattaya for only 10 baht - great value and to get back the taxi bikes are great fun- you can haggle the price down. In the bungalow you have a safe - you set the code for it. There is a fridge for your drinks and food and we got a bowl from reception - so each morning we had ceral and friut on the veranda and at night - before we went out we had a few drinks- If you but the mossy curls from the 7 eleven shops they keep them at bay. There is a very cute dog we named maisey- she answer to anything really as she is Thai !! The pool was really nice- very clean but take care as you get in - there is a surpise - underfoot !! We will stay there again - Jo has some of our clothes- we ran out of space as we bought stuff to take back !! Apart from that it suited us down to the ground - bu we are very easy going and take everything in our stride - lifes to short to be hung up on stuff - If you want things like at home - stay at home . Thailand is a place to experience and enjoy and never judge- everyone has to survive and live somehow.

valschmitt wrote a review Feb 2011,30,Very far from the beach,"We stayed at Inrawadee resort for the week end. The rooms are very simple and basic (small huts) but decorated with a lot of taste. The bathrooms are very badly designed with no space between the water closet and the sink. We did not suffer from mosquitoes although there were holes in the wooden floor. We however slept like babies because the resort is located in a quiet & remote area.    The main problem was that the beach (Jomtien) was relatively far from the hotel (20 minutes walk) with no transportation organized by the hotel. When going to the beach we had to walk first on a small and dangerous road (no side walk) and then on a bigger street. On the way back we used to take local tuk-tuks (song tao) but they would stop at the intersection between the main street and the small road of the hotel, therefore we had to come back walking which is not only very pleasant after a whole day on the beach.","INRAWADEE RESORT - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.877580,100.890259&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.877580,100.890259&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.869840,100.890587|12.871150,100.894218|12.881847,100.897491|12.879808,100.896843|12.884580,100.897720&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.879426,100.892242|12.881090,100.897530|12.874329,100.887398|12.880282,100.884209|12.879130,100.891273|12.868108,100.891670|12.877930,100.891289|12.881065,100.898087|12.881370,100.884338&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883314,100.896751|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.871732,100.889671|12.877643,100.885033&signature=8kVXlS4s6OT7GqsSZkxEr8BKmhY="
