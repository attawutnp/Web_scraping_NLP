Sanchittw wrote a review Jul 2013,30,A good location and a fair price,"I was at Pattaya Beach resort in 2009 and one of the best part of the hotel is its location. Its situated right on the beach road, next to Holiday Inn. The rooms have an excellent view of the beach and ocean only if you have booked an ocean view room. The bathrooms are small but clean and well maintained and have transparent walls and no locking systems. I still did not understand why. The mini bar was well stuffed but everything was a little pricey. The hotel is 15 minutes walk from walking street or we can also take a multiple passenger taxi for only 10 - 15 baht per passenger. One thing to notice was that the hotel had many Indian guests and it can be a little repulsive, even though I am an Indian too.

Gairik Maji wrote a review May 2013,10,Terrible hotel to stay at Pattaya,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 days. Was booked here by Thomas and Cook. The rooms are not spacious. Though they say that its a Beach resort, its impossible for you to get a view of the beach from the first three floors.

kykosushi wrote a review Apr 2011,10,Avoid this place at all cost,"This hotel was included for us in a travel package. When I initially saw the hotel online I was somewhat skeptical of it because of the mixed reviews, but when I stepped off the shuttle in front of the hotel all the bad reviews came to life as this was one of the worst hotels I've ever been in.  Once in the lobby at the front desk I noticed dirty dishes and glasses all over the lobby that had not been picked up and a sign at the front desk counter that read, ""We do not provide sexual massages here. If you would like a sexual massage there are many places outside that we can refer you to."" As the alarms went off in my head I still tried to hold out some hope for this place. The staff seemed pleasant enough and as they gave me my room key I was told that my room had a beautiful garden view.  Upon going to my room the halls were very dimly lit and the hallway smelled of mildew and mold. Once entering the room itself it seemed as though someone came to pull the sheets over the bed but that was literally about it. Not only did the white sheets and blankets have yellow stains all over them, but the bathroom was full of black pubic hair on the counter, the floor and the toilet. As if this wasn't enough, there was dirt and dust all over the floor and the white bath towels had long black hair all over them. And oh, that beautiful garden view, was nothing more than a small patch of grass surrounded by old run down buildings surrounded by trash. My family and I were in this room no longer than 10min before leaving to catch a cab to find a room elsewhere.  As for the location, the hotel is close to beach, no doubt about it. But you do have to walk through a small area of trashy tattoo and massage parlors to get there. For the $80 US per night the travel company refunded us for this place, we were able to find a 5star resort down the street with meals included for a fraction more than this dive.  The Pattaya Beach Resort is listed as a 4star hotel. Seriously, I don't know how that's possible. 1 star would be pushing it.

JuubJib wrote a review Nov 2010,10,This will be my first and last stay,"We are all together 3 people and have seen this hotel booth in a tourism exhibition. They represented themselves as a 4 stars hotel. So we decided to stay there for a short weekend trip. We paid for this hotel at 3,500 baht per night for Deluxe Seaview room. The first time we saw the hotel entrace we were shocked as it definitely not look like a 4 stars hotel as they rent out some part of the land to those shops on the street. When we checked-in, we requested for an extra bed which cost 1,060 baht. When I ask a Philippino receptionist if the hotel has any credit card promotion, she asked me how many card do I have which I consider that as a very very impolite question. After I finished checking in I turned back and saw a Bell boy playing with our belongings (Hat and personal hand bag). He also took the key card from us to take us to the room which is understandable but also put it in his MOUTH!!! The room was quiet small comparing to what we have paid for. The extra bed we have requested for turned out to be a plywood bed with bed sheet NO mattress. The water at the baht tub should run down to the drainage; however, it leak from the baht tub to the floor and the whole baht room become flooded with water. The hotel gave only 1 set of toilet kit (conton bud, shower cab). The house keeping said that even we paid for extra bed they cannot provide us one more glass and mug for coffee. When we walked out of the room the carpet at the corridor was damp and smelly. My friend went to lobby toilet and while she was washing her hands the staff was talking that there is a staff there stealing the guest possession from the room. When we were leaving the hotel the same Bell boy was helping us he was at the same time searching and criticizing the things we put in our car. SO RUDE.

CBKK wrote a review Jul 2010,30,good value but will be run down very soon,"great location direct at the beach road only minutes to everywhere.  had an executive suite sea facing. Very cool. living room and bathroom, lots of space.  rooms are furnished very basic and the finish in the hotel is very poor. The place is brand new and already looks like 3 years.  Housekeeping does not want to change linen as they are short of everything. had to call for towels every day as there was only one.  If you shower the entire bathroom is flooded.  Well few other hick ups here and there.  Would go back due to location and value. If you compare with other hotels, this is a good deal",PATTAYA BEACH RESORT - Hotel Reviews (Thailand),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.943224,100.885796&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.943224,100.885796&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.943296,100.888634|12.946860,100.884850|12.941815,100.887703|12.943372,100.888023|12.942090,100.887321|12.942431,100.886154|12.945370,100.887077|12.946270,100.886261&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.945942,100.888512|12.945222,100.886719|12.945535,100.885284|12.941941,100.884735|12.942083,100.888054|12.939547,100.884132|12.945942,100.888336|12.944043,100.888626|12.945237,100.886757&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.945731,100.888847|12.947556,100.885757|12.940918,100.888573|12.939276,100.885162|12.941266,100.888710|12.945615,100.885139|12.944045,100.887093&signature=3ojmTvmfSEcHRVrnYCu1_flkXvU="
surwat wrote a review Jun 2010,40,Pattaya Beach Resort - Value for money,"Pattaya Beach Resort is situated at the second road, south Pattaya. Near to the Hotel is the Big-C Mall and the Alcazar show center. The resort has very lobby and three swimming pools. Our room was near the Dolphin pool. It is a budget hotel resort. The hotel is free from the disturbance of the night life at Walking Street. As per the standard I rate it on average. The morning breakfast is served at its restaurant with moderate buffet on continental plan. There are many roadside markets and good restaurants near the hotel.    The room we stayed was spacious. The room interiors were modern and was arrange in international standard. It is lovely to spend time at the pool side, even late nights. Its very calm and quiet. One can peacefully take a good long sleep at any time of the day.",PATTAYA BEACH RESORT - Hotel Reviews (Thailand),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.943224,100.885796&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.943224,100.885796&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.943296,100.888634|12.946860,100.884850|12.941815,100.887703|12.943372,100.888023|12.942090,100.887321|12.942431,100.886154|12.945370,100.887077|12.946270,100.886261&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.945942,100.888512|12.945222,100.886719|12.945535,100.885284|12.941941,100.884735|12.942083,100.888054|12.939547,100.884132|12.945942,100.888336|12.944043,100.888626|12.945237,100.886757&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.945731,100.888847|12.947556,100.885757|12.940918,100.888573|12.939276,100.885162|12.941266,100.888710|12.945615,100.885139|12.944045,100.887093&signature=3ojmTvmfSEcHRVrnYCu1_flkXvU="
