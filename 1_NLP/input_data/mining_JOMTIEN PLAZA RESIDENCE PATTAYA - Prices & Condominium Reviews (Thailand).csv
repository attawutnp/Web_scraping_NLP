Bathroom was showing signs of age but had a toilet, shower, and basin. it also had a hair dryer but I didn't use it.  WiFi worked throughout the hotel( In room, lobby, by the pool).

Zé Carioca wrote a review Feb 2016,10,The worst hotel I ever stayed in Thailand.,"I had a tremendous nasty stench of feces in the room coming out of a drain pipe in the bathroom. Room was also full with mosquitos and creeping insects. The TV set was old with a bad image. Air conditioning was old too, very dirty and extremely noisy. No mini bar, no black out curtains, not even a waste bin. No bedside tables, no lamps or light switch at the bed.    My room was on the backside of the building, where was something like a bus terminal or garage with corresponding noise disturbance.    In the bathroom no exhaust fan, no shower door or curtain, no bath amenities, not even a simple piece of hand soap.    This hotel advertises with “Free WiFi in all rooms” and a “Fitness center”. This is just a big scam! The WiFi wasn’t working at all, not in the room nor in the whole building! The so called fitness center is basically just a multi function fitness tower. But this tower is totally unusable because all wire cables were ripped! There was also no air-con in the fitness room. Therefore it’s not only far too hot in there to work out, but one will have the company of plenty of mosquitos as well.    Restaurant staff was rude and ignorant and had practically zero English skills.    Complaints about the not working WiFi and useless fitness center led to nothing. I didn’t even get an apology.    I recommend: Do not stay there!",JOMTIEN PLAZA RESIDENCE PATTAYA - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Thailand),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.900000,100.869446&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.900000,100.869446&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.901447,100.868690|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.903545,100.869637|12.901821,100.869125|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.897036,100.868607|12.899477,100.865768|12.896251,100.869408&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.900798,100.865463|12.897312,100.871132|12.902089,100.869385|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118&signature=Kh91WaA4TBqaF4OnZyX1UJtNmgY="

vanilla1234 wrote a review Feb 2015,20,Good Location but that is the best I can say!!,"I had to find somewhere to stay for 5 days at the very last minute. I chose this place because of its location and by some friends going in and looking at a room for me. They said it was ok and booked it for us. On arrival we were given a room in block C. This is very near the road and very noisy. On being shown the room the handle fell off of the sliding door to the balcony. We then looked at 3 other rooms - each slightly worse than the last. We finally ended up in Block A (which is quieter). It was basic (which I didn't mind) and we were so tired we needed somewhere. The next day I looked round the room and found the cupboards were filthy, the bathroom was old, tired and dirty, the hot plate was filthy and there was not a chair to sit on in the room but two dining chairs on the balcony. Even though their was a kitchen area we didn't have any plates, cutlery or cups. The reception staff are rude and tend to ignore you unless you pointedly ask them a question. The concierge was helpful up to a point - when I asked why I couldn't get on wifi in reception (there is none in the room which is disgraceful in this day and age) all he said was ""I'm on"" and went back to the game he was playing on his phone!! The breakfast was quite good (as long as you don't want a European breakfast) but everything was cold. The shining star was the lady who did the omelettes, she was kind, courteous and great at what she did. On check out the receptionist managed to not say a word to me which I found incredible as she had to give me money back for the 500 baht deposit on the key, check I hadn't stolen anything (you have to sign and pay deposit for everything here) and get me to sign out.    The good points: Location and omelette lady.  The bad points: No wifi, rude staff, badly decorated rooms and general lack of care.    If you have to stay somewhere and their is nowhere else left, you should be ok. Don't expect too much and don't stay their for a long time. Block A and B are better than Block C (which is next to the main road) and try and get as high up as you can.    All in all, not the best nor the worst experience of a hotel I have had, but pretty close.",JOMTIEN PLAZA RESIDENCE PATTAYA - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Thailand),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.900000,100.869446&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.900000,100.869446&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.901447,100.868690|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.903545,100.869637|12.901821,100.869125|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.897036,100.868607|12.899477,100.865768|12.896251,100.869408&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.900798,100.865463|12.897312,100.871132|12.902089,100.869385|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118&signature=Kh91WaA4TBqaF4OnZyX1UJtNmgY="

Claus J wrote a review Apr 2014,20,This hotel doesn't work,"This hotel doesnt work of several reasons.  The cleaning doesnt work. When we checked in, the floors were only sweeped, not cleaned, and same with toilet. Also, during our 10 days stay, the toilet wasnt cleanced ONCE, neither was floor as they only swept it. The bedsheets wasnt cleaned very often, maybe 2 times during our stay.  The AC was making more noise than a broken engine.  When the drain in the shower clogged, we called the reception, which promised to fix it. Nothing was done after that, so for our last 5 days we had to shower in a flooded bathroom, and had to buy towels ourself which we used to keep the floor somewhat dry.  The rooms do NOT have Wifi/internet as promised on site. Also, the wifi in the reception was a laught, slow as a turtle IF it worked. As soon as more than 4-5 people was on it on the same time, you got kicked out of the wifi.  Hotel is packed with grumpy russians, making the whole stay pretty unpleasent. Some of the staff are nice, but the service is below expected.  The pool is ""ok"", but bring your own towels and its not recommended for kids. Also there are no umbrellas/shady area by the pool, which also is on top of the restaurant accessed by stairs, so you have difficulties if handicapped or with strollers.  The breakfast was junk. The hot food was cold and the cold food was hot. Coffee cups was dirty. The restaurant (where the breakfast is served) is under roof but no walls, so birds fly in and out and drop their droppings even in kitchen area.  We asked for a baby cot, which we got after 3 days nagging!  Towels looked like a rarity, we were 2 adults and 2 kids, and all we got was 3 even we asked for more.

UOBX wrote a review Feb 2014,10,"A terrible hotel, overpriced and definitely not recommendable","I stayed at this hotel from December 22, 2013 until January 1, 2014, and I regret every single day. Unfortunately, the booking was through Agoda, and hence, no refund was possible. About everything in this hotel is bad. I am not overly critical, but here is a list of the deficiencies:    I paid almost 100 USD/night in a so-called “junior suite” and expected a minimum standard. This hotel fails in virtually all categories.    The only good thing first:  Rather quiet location (except for some neighbors). Beaches and entertainment areas reachable within few minutes by collect taxi. Nice balconies.    Bad:  Only rudimentary room furniture.  One of the rooms in the “Junior suite"" is almost empty  No suitable working area for computer  Antiquated mini TV sets. One of 2 was not working  No in-room safe  No minibar  Suitcases must be placed on the floor  Too hard pillows  Only two (2) towels, despite 2 bathrooms. More only upon request  No sanitary bags  Electrical switches in inconvenient locations  Free internet only in hotel lobby, but often down  Internet in room costs additionally - despite high room rate  Internet in room useless, incredibly slow, emails not accessible  Poor maintenance of public facilities: dirty elevator, door repair not made  Breakfast included in rate, however lowest standard  Poor housekeeping: room not cleaned for two consecutive days, despite clear sign and request  1 of 2 bathrooms was never ever cleaned and trash basket not emptied  No consistent supply of daily water bottles    I confronted management with my total disappointment. However, since full stay paid in advance through Agoda, no early departure or refund possible. Eventually, I negotiated a free voucher for the internet in the room. However, as mentioned above, the internet in the room is totally useless, and cannot even be used for replication of emails. Beware if you pay for this ""service"".    Recommendations:  1. For potential guests: avoid the hotel by all means  2. For hotel management: to drastically improve management quality  3. For Agoda: to drop this hotel, until improvement is verified on location  4. For me: never book through Agoda anymore, if full price must be paid in advance.

Arnstein T wrote a review Feb 2013,10,Total ripoff,"We booked in advance via a friend who went there personally to book. When we got there the booked room was not available, all they had was a damn expensive family room. That room was more of a flat, and looked very dated (1980s). As for our booking we had three reception staff argue that with us, and they all lied outright to us. Also claimed that the girlfriend of the friend who had booked for us had never been to the hotel, despite her having met us there and come up to check out the room with us. Which the staff all saw. It was surreal. We only stayed the one night since it was too late to find another hotel. First thing in the morning we left.    The hotel was otherwise full of mainly Russians, and as far as we could see was not being maintained. Looked like the owners were squeezing as much money out of it without spending any. It wasn't as clean as you would expect either. Worst was the price of the room.

michael b wrote a review Mar 2012,10,dont bother!!!!,I was very disappointed with this hotel. I regularly sttay in thailand and thought I would try something different....what a mistake!! upon arrival they took me to a room that still wasn't made up and the balcony looked directly into a bus parking area at the back with the buses running with their exhaust going staight into the room if you left the door open. After a struggle they changed my room but were not very happy to do it. The food in the restaurant is wll below standard and i ended up eating from a food cart on the streeet at the front of the restaurant most of the time.  they even messed up the taxi that they werre supposed to organise for me to get to the airport early in the morning on my last day and almost missed my flight. the reception staff werre not helpful at all.  DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!,JOMTIEN PLAZA RESIDENCE PATTAYA - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Thailand),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.900000,100.869446&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.900000,100.869446&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.901447,100.868690|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.903545,100.869637|12.901821,100.869125|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.897036,100.868607|12.899477,100.865768|12.896251,100.869408&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.900798,100.865463|12.897312,100.871132|12.902089,100.869385|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118&signature=Kh91WaA4TBqaF4OnZyX1UJtNmgY="
AyDogg wrote a review Feb 2012,10,"Dirty room, Dirty breakfast","My wife and I booked this hotel as part of our extended honeymoon. We were not expecting anything fabulous but it was reasonably priced and not too far from the beach. When we checked in it took too bell boys to show us to our room (even tho we had one small bag). They nearly knocked us over to rush into the lift before us. We got to our room and it was big enough however it looked like it had hardly been cleaned. It had the towel folded into an elephant alright and the bed was made but the floor was sticky and the tiles in the bathroom fell the wrong way so when you had a shower the water flooded the bathroom and made an island of the toilet for hours. My wife (who speaks thai)had to call reception and ask them to have it redone. This was after our request for a room change was denied until the following morning. In the special request I put that it was our honeymoon..My reward from Jomtien Plaza was a room with two single beds. They said they were full and i could not change until the following day.    The next morning we got to breakfast at 9.40 and the breakfast went until 10. They were obviously trying to run out the food. I looked around and realised that none of the hot food, cold food, stir-frys had any nets or lids over them and they'd been there 3 hours. It also looked as though all the flys in Jomtien beach also had coupons to this breakfast. They had ran out of butter for the 3 days we stayed. All guests were served dry toast    The next day we finally got our room change so that we might share the same bed on our honeymoon. It stank of cigarettes. We just opened all the windows. This new room had a kitchenette. The bench top was dirty, the kitchen sink still had bits of someone elses food in the sink hole. I think the staff here truly believe that cleaning a room is just folding a towel into a swan and putting it on the bed.    A bit of a survival tip. After a shower dry yourself with your t-shirt and use your towel to cover the bed, the linen is about as clean as the floors.",JOMTIEN PLAZA RESIDENCE PATTAYA - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Thailand),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.900000,100.869446&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.900000,100.869446&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.901447,100.868690|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.903545,100.869637|12.901821,100.869125|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.897036,100.868607|12.899477,100.865768|12.896251,100.869408&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.900798,100.865463|12.897312,100.871132|12.902089,100.869385|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118&signature=Kh91WaA4TBqaF4OnZyX1UJtNmgY="
