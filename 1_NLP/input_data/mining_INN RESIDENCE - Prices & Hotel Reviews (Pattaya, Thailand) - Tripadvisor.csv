Alison E wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Happy to have been ""inn residence"" here","We spent the first proper nights of our Thai holiday here and what a great few nights they were. This hotel offers great prices, lovely warm staff and a very comfortable room all located in a little side street, 250m from the beach, in the quieter end of Jomtien while still in reach of all the action if that's what you want. The room was nice and spacious and spotlessly clean, the bathroom comfortable and, most importantly, located in the back of the hotel so it was super quiet. On the roof is a charming deck and pool area with spectacular views of Jomtien. The only downfall - the breakfast which is not the greatest. Tip: If you're looking for a quiet drink before or after heading out, look no further than directly across the road. The two ladies from northern Thailand will go out of their way to make you feel welcome.","INN RESIDENCE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882570,100.881943&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882570,100.881943&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950&signature=GD_heubSBE4V3A9d-CS2qGilMdk="

Samuel_Russell wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Highly enjoyable stay in this hidden gem,"I was staying in a poor quality hotel nearby and the day after I checked in I discovered this hidden gem. I went in to inquire how much the rooms were thinking they would be much higher than the place I was staying in but I was surprised to learn that it was only a few hundred baht a day more. We checked out of the other hotel and moved to this one immediately. I couldn't fault this hotel in anyway really, clean rooms with comfortable beds and the shower was powerful too. The rooms are decorated well and have modern furnishings. The staff were great too so I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The highlight of the hotel was the rooftop spa which was fantastic, it was great to sit on the rooftop with a beer and watch the sun go down.","INN RESIDENCE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882570,100.881943&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882570,100.881943&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950&signature=GD_heubSBE4V3A9d-CS2qGilMdk="

gruzzle wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Fabby time,"Just home from a 12 night stay, hotel was brilliant.  Spotlessly clean, maids in everyday. Large rooms with a fabulous king size bed, a sink, microwave and kettle with tea and coffee, a couple of bottles of water free each day.  The bathroom was again spotless with free toiletries and a large walk in electric shower so constant hot water, however the water to the sink was cold so no hot water for shaving.  The balcony was of fair size but not much of a view, just the front street which was uninteresting I'm afraid.  There is a small sofa and large tv with a few english chanels.  The rooftop pool terrace is brilliant and we were lucky enough to have it to ourselves most of the time. The pool is just a small plunge pool but perfect for cooling off in.  We did have a small issue one day with the pool which we reported to the reception, and to be fair when we returned to hotel after an afternoon out, the problem had been rectified.  I've read in previous reviews that the free wifi is poor, but all i can say is it worked well for me.  All in all had a fabulous stay and would definitely use this hotel again. Although I've given it a 4 i would say 4.5 is more accurate.","INN RESIDENCE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882570,100.881943&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882570,100.881943&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950&signature=GD_heubSBE4V3A9d-CS2qGilMdk="
TP1888 wrote a review Sep 2015,40,Nice big room,"Booked the suite with my wife and daughter. The suite has a double and a single bed placed well apart from each other. This placing allowed my daughter a little privacy as the single bed is in a small alcove.    There is a large flat screen, music system and microwave. The aircon is good and a large balcony with table and chairs. The room is very new and also has a small sofa and table which is nice.    The bathroom is large with the only small problem is access to get in and out of the shower difficult getting over the bath.    It is on a very quiet soi but only a minute or two to the beach. Baht busses constantly run from the end of the soi with motorbike taxis also available.    Staff very well dressed and polite. Maybe the cleaners could be a little quieter in the mornings talking loudly and their walkie talkies very loud.    Stay again yes for sure. Jomtien and Pattaya again maybe not.","INN RESIDENCE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882570,100.881943&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882570,100.881943&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950&signature=GD_heubSBE4V3A9d-CS2qGilMdk="
leon9mm wrote a review Jul 2015,30,Was an ok stay,"Really far up the jomtien road...away from most of the life on the road..  But the beach really is at the bottom of the street..  It's easy to find.    The room is big,has all the amenities it portrays,including the large tv..  The pool is really small but nice...    For the money it's just about ok..  Look out your window you see an old crumbling wall about 2 feet away..  No light gets into the room..which makes it look abit dreary..    When we arrived at the hotel the electric was off..  We spent 5 hours in a sweat box with the kids trying to sleep after a long drive here..  But we put this down to can happen anywhere in Thailand..    The one thing bugged me about this stay was at check in the young lady said that one room had a conformation for 1 person..  The other 2 rooms conformation for 2 people..  In actual fact my booking threw hotels.com was for 3 and 3 and 2 in the rooms..  The site clearly shows that the rooms hold max of 3 ..  I explained all this to her but she kept repeating the same thing..  I did say I could show her online but that the Internet was not working as well as everything else as the electric was off..  I asked her did she want me to phone hotels.com to confirm for her..she said yes..  My wife said to her in thai that would not happen and she would be showed on the booking when Internet was restored..  I was for leaving there and then for another hotel as the heat and nonsense coming from her was making me angry..    End of story was when later my wife went to show her she was not there..  We did not see her over the next 4 days...    Because of the ignorant bull headed attitude of this staff member I or my family or my friends will never set foot in this hotel again..  And no apology for the free sauna for 5 hours either....","INN RESIDENCE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882570,100.881943&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882570,100.881943&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950&signature=GD_heubSBE4V3A9d-CS2qGilMdk="

The hotel is new and could be great, but the hotel is badly built, with many ""quick solutions"". Loose faucet, spilt paint on the floor and so on. The beds were like sleeping on the floor. It was the hardest mattress I've ever slept on. The staff is really unfriendly.

Alison E wrote a review Mar 2018,40,"Happy to have been ""inn residence"" here","We spent the first proper nights of our Thai holiday here and what a great few nights they were. This hotel offers great prices, lovely warm staff and a very comfortable room all located in a little side street, 250m from the beach, in the quieter end of Jomtien while still in reach of all the action if that's what you want. The room was nice and spacious and spotlessly clean, the bathroom comfortable and, most importantly, located in the back of the hotel so it was super quiet. On the roof is a charming deck and pool area with spectacular views of Jomtien. The only downfall - the breakfast which is not the greatest. Tip: If you're looking for a quiet drink before or after heading out, look no further than directly across the road.

Samuel_Russell wrote a review Jan 2017,50,Highly enjoyable stay in this hidden gem,"I was staying in a poor quality hotel nearby and the day after I checked in I discovered this hidden gem. I went in to inquire how much the rooms were thinking they would be much higher than the place I was staying in but I was surprised to learn that it was only a few hundred baht a day more. We checked out of the other hotel and moved to this one immediately. I couldn't fault this hotel in anyway really, clean rooms with comfortable beds and the shower was powerful too. The rooms are decorated well and have modern furnishings. The staff were great too so I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The highlight of the hotel was the rooftop spa which was fantastic, it was great to sit on the rooftop with a beer and watch the sun go down.","INN RESIDENCE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882570,100.881943&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882570,100.881943&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950&signature=GD_heubSBE4V3A9d-CS2qGilMdk="

gruzzle wrote a review Dec 2015,40,Fabby time,"Just home from a 12 night stay, hotel was brilliant.  Spotlessly clean, maids in everyday. Large rooms with a fabulous king size bed, a sink, microwave and kettle with tea and coffee, a couple of bottles of water free each day.  The bathroom was again spotless with free toiletries and a large walk in electric shower so constant hot water, however the water to the sink was cold so no hot water for shaving.  The balcony was of fair size but not much of a view, just the front street which was uninteresting I'm afraid.  There is a small sofa and large tv with a few english chanels.  The rooftop pool terrace is brilliant and we were lucky enough to have it to ourselves most of the time. The pool is just a small plunge pool but perfect for cooling off in.  We did have a small issue one day with the pool which we reported to the reception, and to be fair when we returned to hotel after an afternoon out, the problem had been rectified.  I've read in previous reviews that the free wifi is poor, but all i can say is it worked well for me.  All in all had a fabulous stay and would definitely use this hotel again. Although I've given it a 4 i would say 4.5 is more accurate.","INN RESIDENCE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882570,100.881943&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882570,100.881943&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950&signature=GD_heubSBE4V3A9d-CS2qGilMdk="
TP1888 wrote a review Sep 2015,40,Nice big room,"Booked the suite with my wife and daughter. The suite has a double and a single bed placed well apart from each other. This placing allowed my daughter a little privacy as the single bed is in a small alcove.    There is a large flat screen, music system and microwave. The aircon is good and a large balcony with table and chairs. The room is very new and also has a small sofa and table which is nice.    The bathroom is large with the only small problem is access to get in and out of the shower difficult getting over the bath.    It is on a very quiet soi but only a minute or two to the beach. Baht busses constantly run from the end of the soi with motorbike taxis also available.    Staff very well dressed and polite. Maybe the cleaners could be a little quieter in the mornings talking loudly and their walkie talkies very loud.    Stay again yes for sure. Jomtien and Pattaya again maybe not.","INN RESIDENCE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882570,100.881943&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882570,100.881943&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950&signature=GD_heubSBE4V3A9d-CS2qGilMdk="
leon9mm wrote a review Jul 2015,30,Was an ok stay,"Really far up the jomtien road...away from most of the life on the road..  But the beach really is at the bottom of the street..  It's easy to find.    The room is big,has all the amenities it portrays,including the large tv..  The pool is really small but nice...    For the money it's just about ok..  Look out your window you see an old crumbling wall about 2 feet away..  No light gets into the room..which makes it look abit dreary..    When we arrived at the hotel the electric was off..  We spent 5 hours in a sweat box with the kids trying to sleep after a long drive here..  But we put this down to can happen anywhere in Thailand..    The one thing bugged me about this stay was at check in the young lady said that one room had a conformation for 1 person..  The other 2 rooms conformation for 2 people..  In actual fact my booking threw hotels.com was for 3 and 3 and 2 in the rooms..  The site clearly shows that the rooms hold max of 3 ..  I explained all this to her but she kept repeating the same thing..  I did say I could show her online but that the Internet was not working as well as everything else as the electric was off..  I asked her did she want me to phone hotels.com to confirm for her..she said yes..  My wife said to her in thai that would not happen and she would be showed on the booking when Internet was restored..  I was for leaving there and then for another hotel as the heat and nonsense coming from her was making me angry..    End of story was when later my wife went to show her she was not there..  We did not see her over the next 4 days...    Because of the ignorant bull headed attitude of this staff member I or my family or my friends will never set foot in this hotel again..  And no apology for the free sauna for 5 hours either....","INN RESIDENCE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882570,100.881943&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882570,100.881943&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950&signature=GD_heubSBE4V3A9d-CS2qGilMdk="
v432 wrote a review Jul 2015,10,Not impressed,"The hotel is located in a dirty soi close to the beach. The hotel is new and could be great, but the hotel is badly built, with many ""quick solutions"". Loose faucet, spilt paint on the floor and so on. The beds were like sleeping on the floor. It was the hardest mattress I've ever slept on. The staff is really unfriendly. We never got a smile from them, they did not bother to book us taxis, and most of them did not speak good enough English to work at a hotel.","INN RESIDENCE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882570,100.881943&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882570,100.881943&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950&signature=GD_heubSBE4V3A9d-CS2qGilMdk="
