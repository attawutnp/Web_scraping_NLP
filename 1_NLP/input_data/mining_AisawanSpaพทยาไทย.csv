Spa treatments make you feel pampered,ม.ค. ค.ศ. 2014 • ธุรกิจ,"I was warmly received by a member of staff who informed me that all the massage therapists were qualified and certified in the various massage treatments. I was then showed a list of all their treatments on offer as well as special packages and prices. Suggestions were made for the type of treatments I was interested in and I opted for a '4 hands body massage' followed by a facial treatment. A 25% discount was offered for morning bookings. Overall service was efficient and warmly welcoming. Clean and calm 'zen' ambiance. You certainly feel well taken care of. The two ladies who gave me the '4 hands massage' worked expertly well in unison, seemingly applying the same amount of pressure. How did they do that? Treatment is followed by a warming cup of tea and no rush to dress and leave. I left the spa on a cloud after a total of 2 hours and 20 minutes of pampering!",AisawanSpaพทยาไทย,
Excellent Service+Nice Staff,None,"I haven't stay at pullman as I go Pattaya for business and my company already booked another one for me. But heard that Asiawan spa is good down there, so email and and see if they can offer me with discount as hotel guest is having buy one get one free currently. The staff response is very fast and sincere. They offer me 25%off first which is acceptable. And then I realize that I need pick up service, surprisingly, they offer me free one which seldom come with such high-level hotel with just a guest who come just for spa. The good experience start from the hotel pick-up from my lobby, Staff English is good which is hard to find at BKK and they are nice to chat with you. When arrive, sun is big and staff open umbrella for me which giving me warm feeling as I just come for spa only. The spa manager come to welcome me. She don't mind me taking photos around and she actually help me take photos with me and suggesting the best location, too. The massage lady is good although the english compare not the way like those welcome staff but still can communicate. She making me so comfortable with the strong press that I need, not too strong but just fit. overall comment & experience is unforgettable warm and excellent.",AisawanSpaพทยาไทย,
