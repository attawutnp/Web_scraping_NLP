BangkokJock wrote a review Dec 2020,30,Dirty rooms broken furniture,"Stayed here during the KMK50 trail run event, resort was fully booked. We arrived late so got one of the lousiest rooms in the resort. Floor & sheets were dusty, fridge not working, closet doors broken, towel rail in the bathroom was rusty and about to snap off. When we checked out in the afternoon the next day, no one was around and the security guard told us to just leave the key at the counter because the staff had gone home!","AB' PALUSO RETREAT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.944608,100.979378&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.944608,100.979378|12.944608,100.979378&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.972740,100.976349|12.954542,100.909927|12.912810,100.939194|12.950742,100.937111|12.989520,100.925217|12.974793,100.976830|12.947508,100.954559|12.909728,100.944443|12.909081,100.917610&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890711,100.935692|12.908712,100.916000|12.939422,100.916946|12.918122,100.928093|12.961980,100.921494|12.920447,100.960480|12.924349,100.912750|12.936882,100.928726|12.906045,100.919914&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.986191,100.919518|12.947436,100.931625|12.912784,100.926170|12.962568,100.909744|12.975434,100.913986|12.948500,100.932617|12.971217,100.919937|12.942660,100.941483&signature=I-QCbVwe1CctdGt80xVJdXEFUZM="
Helmut S wrote a review Aug 2020,30,A resort in the middle of nowhere,"Due to the Coronavirus pandemic the hotel was closed but temporarily opened for us. Our friend whose house is in walking distance had booked 3 rooms for us so that we could stay nearby as he had invited us for his birthday celebration. The hotel can be reached from highway 7 leading to Rayong but who would stay here, far away from the sea. We had pool view rooms and of course it was quiet because we were the only guests. The hotel comprise of a bar, a big restaurant, well equipped gym, spa, pool and garden but except for the pool the facilities were closed thus I cannot comment on the food/breakfast normally served. The rooms are spacious, the room facilities are sufficient, good lighting, wardrobe, fridge, desk; my friends complained that the bed were too high and the aircondition did not cool sufficiently. In 2 rooms the cover of the toilet seat was not fixed at all. I cannot imagine to stay at a hotel in the middle of nowhere but probably they fill the hotel with golfers and through functions. The staff we met only at the check in, friendly.","AB' PALUSO RETREAT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.944608,100.979378&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.944608,100.979378|12.944608,100.979378&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.972740,100.976349|12.954542,100.909927|12.912810,100.939194|12.950742,100.937111|12.989520,100.925217|12.974793,100.976830|12.947508,100.954559|12.909728,100.944443|12.909081,100.917610&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890711,100.935692|12.908712,100.916000|12.939422,100.916946|12.918122,100.928093|12.961980,100.921494|12.920447,100.960480|12.924349,100.912750|12.936882,100.928726|12.906045,100.919914&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.986191,100.919518|12.947436,100.931625|12.912784,100.926170|12.962568,100.909744|12.975434,100.913986|12.948500,100.932617|12.971217,100.919937|12.942660,100.941483&signature=I-QCbVwe1CctdGt80xVJdXEFUZM="
Equinetravels wrote a review Dec 2019,10,Worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in.,"This hotel is a huge disappointment, the rooms are dirty, the breakfast is cold and repetitive. The restaurant is horribly overpriced with the cocktails starting at 220baht and the food being overpriced for basic stuff. 150baht for a takeaway coffee. It’s ridiculous. While the staff on reception are lovely and helpful the bar staff are useless, slow and incompetent they had to google how to make the cocktails from their own menu!

DhivehiTraveller wrote a review Jul 2019,50,A great place to relax!,"We stayed at AB Paluso for 4 night nights. The room was well furnished and spacious with a view of the pool. We seemed to have stayed during low season, so we basically had the whole place to ourselves. The property has a lot of greenery, and its outside the city so traffic noise was very minimal, making it a very relaxing stay at the hotel.    We had most of our meals at the hotel restaurant, everything tasted great. The menu, while not too big, had enough variety to keep us from getting bored with the food. Breakfast wasn’t the usual buffet (maybe because only few guests were staying at the time), we just had to order what we wanted.    My daughter really enjoyed the pool. There’s also a gym room which is well equipped, and a spa, and conference room (which we didn’t use).    There is a nice bar area overlooking the pool, with a pool table and a foosball table for entertainment.    Also, there is a small shop within the hotel which had basic items you might need. There is also a 7/11 and BigC Mini within walking distance from the hotel.    The staff were very helpful and always greeted us with a smile.    We will be visiting again!","AB' PALUSO RETREAT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.944608,100.979378&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.944608,100.979378|12.944608,100.979378&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.972740,100.976349|12.954542,100.909927|12.912810,100.939194|12.950742,100.937111|12.989520,100.925217|12.974793,100.976830|12.947508,100.954559|12.909728,100.944443|12.909081,100.917610&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890711,100.935692|12.908712,100.916000|12.939422,100.916946|12.918122,100.928093|12.961980,100.921494|12.920447,100.960480|12.924349,100.912750|12.936882,100.928726|12.906045,100.919914&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.986191,100.919518|12.947436,100.931625|12.912784,100.926170|12.962568,100.909744|12.975434,100.913986|12.948500,100.932617|12.971217,100.919937|12.942660,100.941483&signature=I-QCbVwe1CctdGt80xVJdXEFUZM="

bukibuki wrote a review Jan 2018,10,"HORRIBLE HOTEL, ROOM WITH NO WINDOW, NO ELECTRICITY AND NO WATER.","I stayed there during Wonderfruit Festival in December 2017  Checked in at 7pm and left for the festival.  Arrived back at midnight to find NO ELECTRICITY AND NO WATER.  My room had no window only the one front door, so if I sleep with my door open either the mosquitoes or an intruder could kill me. So I waited for the electricity to come back for about 1-2 hours in the car until 2AM and there was still no sign of electricity I had to check out and find another hotel at 2AM!    In the morning i return to ask for the full refund which the manager agreed in verbal to not worry they will give me a refund for sure. The next day I called the hotel and they lied that they already contacted the bank for the refund so I waited for 30 days.    NO REFUND. THEY JUST LIED TO ME. So i contacted them through booking.com and they said they change their mind about the refund. So no refund for me because I used the facility (YES STAYED THERE FOR 2 HOURS WITH NO ELECTRICITY AND NO WATER.)

Garden view rooms, which we all had were dated but comfortable! Bed sheets were not changed in 4 nights, which is bad when you have been dancing in a field for 3 days. 2 out of the 4 days, the room was even cleaned. Breakfast was cold each day and we had to ask them to get us cereal and fruit after they said there was none left. Pool service was slow and they dis nor bring cutlery or condiments with the food, we had to ask.

Ray10661066 wrote a review Feb 2017,20,SAD,"Popped in to this new resort , just 6 minutes from me.  Initially quite impressed, looked good and clean.  Restaurant and bar area are totally separate (good) and both are inside (good) and both are air conditioned (good).  Lovely pool and surrounding area, spotlessly clean.  Viewed a couple of rooms, (just to be nosey), more than acceptable.  Entered the bar area, played pool on a table that has seen better days!!  Asked for a Cocktail and a Chang.  The Cocktail when it eventually arrived (15 minutes), I felt was very ordinary and overpriced, 180 Bhat.  The Chang never materialised!!  After searching for 10 minutes or so, the barman informed me that they had no Chang and offered me a Leo!  I declined and asked for a glass of red wine instead.  ""No wine sir, sorry "".  Finished Cocktail, paid and left!!!!  Totally disappointed in what initially seemed a very nice place.  Feel sad for the owners/investors.  Someone has tried really hard to get people in and when they do arrive they let them down terribly.  I accept that this may be a new venture/ resort, however they need to organise and run things a lot better to survive.  I may pop back again in a month or so, just to check ????

Southernspirit wrote a review May 2012,50,Family stay - the little difference with this Resort,"A different Pattaya, perfect for a young family: no red light atmosphere in front of the hotel, no traffic jam, no noise ...  In April we stayed in this small, cozy resort a bit out of town close to Siam Country Club and liked it very much. The perfect location for me as a golfer - every day another golf course, just few minutes away. Free Wifi all over the resort, so I could go online when I wanted without worrying about the cost. And when we wanted to go out in the evening, they provided a top babysitter (our little one loved her).  They have new management for 2 months and this is the best that happened to this hotel. They have renovated a lot, the service is good and friendly, live sport is shown on 2 screens in the pub, and the best: parties with BBQ in the garden for famous sport events which can be watched on Pattayas largest screen - either while sitting in the garden or from the swimming pool! Yes, you can swim, and still watch this huge screen ;-)  The rooms are nice and have large, comfortable beds, of course, air condition, minibar, etc. The prices in the restaurant are moderate, and the food is just great.  The best is the friendly and very personal management. The fulfilled our wishes whatever was possible. We had sent them a booking email and got a nice long staying discount. And the airport pickup in a BMW 7 limousine for only 2500 baht - amazing (the driver speaks really English).  By minibus you are in the center of Pattaya within 15 minutes, and it can even bring you to nice beaches south of Pattaya or to the ferryboat to Koh Larn.","AB' PALUSO RETREAT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.944608,100.979378&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.944608,100.979378|12.944608,100.979378&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.972740,100.976349|12.954542,100.909927|12.912810,100.939194|12.950742,100.937111|12.989520,100.925217|12.974793,100.976830|12.947508,100.954559|12.909728,100.944443|12.909081,100.917610&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890711,100.935692|12.908712,100.916000|12.939422,100.916946|12.918122,100.928093|12.961980,100.921494|12.920447,100.960480|12.924349,100.912750|12.936882,100.928726|12.906045,100.919914&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.986191,100.919518|12.947436,100.931625|12.912784,100.926170|12.962568,100.909744|12.975434,100.913986|12.948500,100.932617|12.971217,100.919937|12.942660,100.941483&signature=I-QCbVwe1CctdGt80xVJdXEFUZM="
