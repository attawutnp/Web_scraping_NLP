UKDiggby wrote a review Nov 2018,40,Nice bar but....,"This bar is in Soi Metro and is very convenient for Central Pattaya, there is food available and good prices and the staff are good and very attentive. There is Pool table and we wanted a game, but the table was being hogged by a group of men who seemed to use the bar lots.    I asked if we could have a game and was told no despite having my name down for over two hours. We left and returned the following day to find the same group playing again. We had food and left to go to another bar to play pool. We had a look at the rooms there and they seem clean and large and would have no problem staying there.","KILKENNY BAR AND GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930218,100.884605&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930218,100.884605&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446&signature=_nzv6r93VOI_99-HhFTxvtHM39s="
Dan G wrote a review Nov 2018,50,Great bar and restaurant for people watching on LK Metro,"I have not stayed at the guesthouse but I have started going to the bar and restaurant with frequency. Although I do not play pool, they have a very nice pool table. The prices of the food and drinks are very reasonable and you do not have to buy two drinks at a time like the place across the street. The seating in the bar is very comfortable and there are many nice TVs to watch sporting events. There is always a lot of action in front of the bar which is great for people watching. They have great nightly dinner specials. The pork chop and the seafood spaghetti are very good.","KILKENNY BAR AND GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930218,100.884605&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930218,100.884605&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446&signature=_nzv6r93VOI_99-HhFTxvtHM39s="

m00y0ng wrote a review Jan 2018,30,Sunday roasted lamb,"So... went to try the Kilkenny’s sunday roasted lamb... I visited first time the venue, if not the Breakfast Pattaya club Facebook group, I wouldn’t think to try, to be honest the place is.. hmm... modest and tired... not to mention the „ raw „ style service... The portion of the meat was similar, what I witnessed last week in Robin Hood and it was served with the very nice, thick gravy on already... I know some don’t like it on this way, but as a marketing tool, understandable... No chewy bites, but some drier ones... the slightly fatty parts – I like so much - were easy edible, but still almost no lambish flavor... The yorkie concept was something different I met until now, but I liked it very much, exceptionally good texture and taste for my taste... On the other side I don’t liked the one whole baked potato idea, I ate only the fried skins, left the centre on the table...anyway, there was no any problem with the potato, just my very own taste... my friend for example liked it... The veggies were good and nice variety, especially with the ultra tasty mint sauce I fallen in love...

Evel P wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Very Good Daily Special,"I had the pork chop special in the restaurant of Kilkenny Bar & Guesthouse on LK Metro. For the price, it was a good meal. By Pattaya standards for Western food, it was quite cheap considering portion size, quality of ingredients and skillful preparation.    It was a substantial chop, not thick but large. It came with mashed potatoes, gravy and vegetables. The portions of mash and veggies were larger than you usually get in Pattaya restaurants. Bottled beer is also very reasonably priced at Kilkenny, so I got a filling meal for less than I would usuallyspend for a Western dinner in Pattaya.    The pork chop had been fried nicely and had a lot of flavor. The vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli and carrots) hadn't been boiled too long and tasted quite fresh. The mashed potatoes were excellent and the cook hadn't skimped on the butter, that's for sure. The gravy was the weakest link; not much flavor and too salty. Thankfully it came on the side in a gravy boat and not on the plate. I left the gravy alone and tucked into the rest with an occasional thought to Kenny McCormick and South Park.    I ate at Kilkenny around 10 p.m. and it was busy. About 80% of the seats were taken inside and out. Kilkenny is an open-front restaurant and many of its seats provide an excellent vantage point for people watching.    Bottom line: I won't hesitate to try another special at Kilkenny. The rest of the menu wasn't particularly inspiring, the usual collection of pub food and Thai standard dishes.","KILKENNY BAR AND GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930218,100.884605&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930218,100.884605&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446&signature=_nzv6r93VOI_99-HhFTxvtHM39s="

AlexBourboN wrote a review Dec 2015,30,Amazing kitchen. Great athmosphere. Weak room,"As was described by another reviews the athmosphere is amazing good. Nice staff, amazing tasty kitchen (Here is the best Tom Yam soup I ate this trip!). Good service (you can take fresh towels and other staff in the corridor if you need). Good location - LK Metro !    The Room was superior one (4th floor - the biggest room with private balcony) View from the balcony is good one for ""Solo tourist"". But the room itself was not good one. First issue: bad smell from bathroom which fill all the room (everyone you invite to the room is shocked). Second - the door between room and bathroom is transperent and light is fallen directly to the bed - it is not good to sleep without a mask (Thanks Turkish airlines for the mask :) ). And the last - the furniture is about furniture in the room :) seems it requires replacement (not sure it can be repaired). WIFI in the room is not stable one (good in bar) Ah, near to forget. The private save in the room was closed and noone knew the code. it was replaced to new one next day but it was not easy to explain that I want my estate save    I'd suggest staff to improve English ;)","KILKENNY BAR AND GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930218,100.884605&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930218,100.884605&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446&signature=_nzv6r93VOI_99-HhFTxvtHM39s="

I have not stayed here as I feared it may be a tad too noisy but the room price was good I recall and the food was both tasty and value for money.

You also get a choice of cereals and sandwiches - nothing is too much trouble.    All extremely excellent quality and served up by the most amazingly friendly staff.

I was gutted one night when the kitched was shut . This seem to happen about 11pm but the manager told me they are planning on putting a food shack outside so I can get my curry fix at all hours.

CHMbangkok wrote a review Nov 2013,40,Friendly Guesthouse in the middle of the Action!,"The Kilkenny Bar and Guesthouse is ideal for both a longterm stay or just a weekend away from home. The staff is friendly and helpfull with a cool guy as Manager keeping all things together. He is also there to help with what ever issue you may have and he never runs out on hints about what to do and where to go.    The Guesthouse is located on Soi LK Metro, one of Pattayas centers for nightlife, fun and action. Basically you can just stay on Soi LK Metro, everything you are looking for in Pattaya is available here. Restaurants, Bars and you can also choose from many many different nighlife spots Pattaya is so famous for. Soi LK Metro is surrounded by Soi Bukhao, Soi Lenkee and Soi Diana, all just as entertaining as LK Metro itself.    Being a guesthouse there is no such nonsense as a gym or a pool, but never mind because the beach is just a 10min walk away with all the water and sports activities you can imagine.    Room and Bar prices are on the lower end of the scale with the service being exactly what you would expect and need, with a Thai smile provided at most times.  The rooms undergo a tastefull upgrade at the moment. Rooms provide all you need like king size bed, fgridge with minibar, aircon, TV with international cable TV, room safe and ensuite bathroom with hot/cold shower.  On occasional nights you will be entertained with cool live performances. To top it off a professional pool table is available as well to test your skills and there is always an opponent to challenge.","KILKENNY BAR AND GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930218,100.884605&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930218,100.884605&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446&signature=_nzv6r93VOI_99-HhFTxvtHM39s="
stonemanSydney wrote a review Sep 2013,40,Middle of the action,"I stayed in Rm34/3rd floor - prebooked 2 months in advance as I wanted this room.    Large rectangular room with large separate bathroom with shower & toilet at separate ends. Wardrobe, dresser, lounge + chair, bedside light, flat screen TV, fridge (stocked with drinks), good aircon & safe. Balcony with round table & chairs overlooking both directions of LK Metro running full length of the room.    Cleaned daily, no problem leaving my laptop, camera, coins on the dresser though I believe the occasional tip ensures good service. Only 2 minor points, firstly no power point in the bathroom for shaving (but this is common in guesthouse accom. throughout Thailand, and secondly, expect to hear music until 3am though this wasn’t a real problem to me as my bedtime was usually between 2-4am. Keep in mind that there is no lift so if stairs are a problem.......    I paid (low season) 700 baht per night + 1000 baht key deposit. As I stayed for 1 week I was given a 750 baht voucher for Champagne Agogo. A solid option if you want to be in the heart of the action.","KILKENNY BAR AND GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930218,100.884605&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930218,100.884605&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446&signature=_nzv6r93VOI_99-HhFTxvtHM39s="

seabookuk wrote a review Nov 2011,30,GOOD ROOMS BUT KILKENNY EMPLOYS ILLEGAL WORKERS,"I stayed at the Kilkenny Inn, a Guest House / Bar located in the entertainment area of Central Pattaya, for 2 weeks in July 2011. When I arrived at the hotel, I was introduced to the Manager; a friendly tattoed Englishman in his mid 30s called ZAK. He showed me to my Standard Room and said that if I have any problems, I should contact him. The room itself was great considering that I was only paying Baht 550 per night. It was well decorated and had a good bed and shower room.    At the start of my second week on one particular day, my room wasn't cleaned. I went downstairs to the bar and asked for Zak, the Manager. The cashier then told me ""we no have Zak work here"". I then reminded her that she had introduced me to him the previous week. She then insisted ""we no have manager Zak work here|"" and walked away from the bar. I then spoke to one of the bar staff about the cleaning problem with my room, which they promptly rectified.    Later that evening, I was talking to an ex-pat in the bar. I told him about the cofusion with the Manager Zak and his apparent disappearance. The ex-pat told me that Zak had been working there illegally and had to leave as he had reason to believe that the Immigration Police were onto him. He also told me that the owner employs several Burmese cleaners who were also working contrary to the term of their Immigration visas.    To conclude, I feel that the Kilkenny Inn is a well run Guest House with fair nightly rates. However, by employing the likes of Zak and the Burmese cleaners they run the risk of being raided by the Thai Immigration Police at any time. Most law abiding tourists would not want to experience the embarassment and humiliation of being at the Kilkenny Inn when such a raid takes place.","KILKENNY BAR AND GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930218,100.884605&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930218,100.884605&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446&signature=_nzv6r93VOI_99-HhFTxvtHM39s="
