troll m wrote a review Feb 2017,10,"Scammed, with a smile!","Due to a mis-booking, I was referred to a nearby hotel, the Suksubai Resort, Pattaya.    After arrival and during the check-in process, as per the norm, I enquired as to the price per night. The night manager flashed me a beaming smile and cordially informed me that it was 1300 THB for 2 nights.

As usual, the poor Farang has to cough up and once again - another scammer wins, again. The same female colleague from the previous evening sat stony-faced next to him. I had the impression that she had seen this all before.    As for the premises themselves, there were hairs in the bath and dried urine on the toilet seat.

Raju Saha wrote a review Jan 2015,30,Good Hotel but far away from South Pattaya Beach,"Well i have stayed here for 2 night and my experience was very bad on first night but somehow managed. The hotel was running though a renovation stage so lot of dust around and there was a electricity issue on the first day which has caused lift not working and also Wi-Fi, Bathroom Gyser, Cable TV not working. We had reached at hotel at 3:00PM, after check-in when i asked about Lunch they told that cook is left for the day though somehow we manegd something outside. When we returned from sightseeing on evening at 8:00PM and asked for dinner the answer remain same from reception that cook has left for the day. The room was real good but that is only the possitive sight of that hotel apart from this i didn't see any good sight of the hotel nor even the location. The famous South Pattaya Beach and the Walking Street is far away from the hotel. Somebody must to hire Motorbike to reach there. They had provided complementary breakfast which was good. Because of service and the location i am giving average rating to this hotel.

angely_angel wrote a review Jan 2015,30,Ordinary stay,"I read that many had very good experience with Suksabai Residence. I guess mine was just ordinary and nothing much to be excited about.    I traveled with husband and my one and a half year old boy    We got checked into the 1st floor room. The recep could not find my booking initially. I booked through Expedia. Hence I suggest for travellers to confirm booking with the hotel after receiving confirmation from Expedia just to be sure. There was wifi in our room and it comes with a basic kitchenette.    The good-  Comfortable bed  Enough space in room  Private balcony  Good variety of channels on TV  Has a small baby pool    The downside (personal preference)  Bed is too high - dangerous for kid  No cot provided  Toilet shower area is very small with faulty door  Have to put on shoes when we use the balcony, would be better if they clean the floor  I read that the hotel is opened in 2012 but I find the room facilities quite old  Our sink in the toilet choked and they removed the sink stopper to allow water to flow faster  Staffs are not very friendly despite reading the other reviews.    Cant comment on food as our room does not come with breakfast and we didnt order any room service. It's pretty near to Outlet Mall, got a cab from hotel to send us there for 300 baht for 1 way. Hailing a cab from the roadside back to hotel was 150baht. But it's hard to get a taxi on the road, hence better to get hotel to get a taxi for you. But as expected they will charge you much higher than getting a taxi yourself.    I guess the better reviews came from travelers who stayed in the suites.

David K wrote a review Dec 2014,30,Holiday,"I've lived in Thailand for 14yrs so I having a pretty good understanding of what is what and what to expect, on recommendation I booked a suit room on the 6th floor which without breakfast is 2700bht per night (expensive for Thailand), the suit was clean but for this price I certainly expected satellitetv and it only had cable which despite the 50"" lcd was a very low quality picture, the hotel had also just started some renovationswhen I checked in which woke me up early each morning and was going on all day. If you rent a suit you intend on spending time in it during the day as well as the night, giventhat Pattaya has just finished the rainy season and is now in high season this is notthe time to make renovations, the leather sofa in the suit lounge was the most uncomfortable I've ever sat on and there were no electric plug socets next to the bed for charging your cell phone and tablet and both the lounge and bedroom would have benefited from ceilng fans, I also put the 'make up room' sign on the suit door at 10am and on my return maybe 3hrs later my room hadn't been cleaned, very poor maid service.

farestay wrote a review Jun 2014,40,Very comfortable,"The best part of this hotel is the room. Comfortable with all amenities you'd need. Private balcony ensures a sit out in the evenings in case you don't wish to venture out. Just that the air conditioning unit could have been a bit higher in the balcony to avoid hot air being blown put in your face. Did not like the small, dingy bathroom.    Courteous staff. Small but excellent pool. Location wise it is a bit far from 2nd road and beach road which means you spend a lot commuting. But I think it's covered by the fact that the prices are very pocket friendly here without the compromise of quality. A very large night market takes place like 10 min walk from the hotel. Local restaurants, super marts & pubs can be found 5 min walk from the hotel. They even assist you in hiring motor bikes & cars in case.    Finding it is a bit tricky as locals say ...

Andy C wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Sunshine and rain,"Just came back from Pattaya after a 3 nights stay at Suksabai Residence.    I really liked the room, the amenities such as the nice and refreshing swimming pool and the result of the cleaning personell. Even the food, was it Thai or International was very acceptable such as the prices asked for that.    One thing what I did not like at all was the No-smoking policy. I booked a smoking room, I received a reconfirmation but when I entered the room there was this 5000 THB fine leaflet.  I talked to the reception, they did refuse to return my total payment as well as they could not give me my smoking room.

StefaninoElba wrote a review Feb 2014,50,a pleasant surprise,"I stayed at this hotel for 1 month , I confess that I was a little worried because for the first time I was traveling with his wife and daughter only 10 months old , but since our arrival we felt good immediately , in the living room had a large sofa and a LCD TV with home theater system , the kitchen was stocked with large refrigerator, microwave, 2 ring cookers and a nice table , the bedroom was large and confortable and also with an LCD TV, the bathroom was large with a jacuzzi. We asked for a little bed for the baby that was immediately provided with the payment of a small fee. Sometimes we had dinner in the room and I have to say that the service was fast and friendly . The pool is not huge but it is more than enough for a hotel with about 60 rooms , however it was clean and it was too important for my daughter , it was also possible to eat at the pool. The distance from the center of pattaya is only a 20 minute walk away but for those who do not want to walk there is a taxi service that a couple of times a day is free. It remains only to thank everyone from Bjorn and his wife Toy until Mokol and Sek and all the guys at the front desk and security with which I must apologize for not leaving a tip for a little misunderstanding .

Chris R wrote a review Jan 2014,50,"Excellent Value for Money, Excellent Staff","I stayed here for three weeks during the peak season and intend to return upon my next visit to Pattaya. The staff are all very friendly and most speak passable English with some being nearly fluent. The rooms are sparkling, are cleaned daily (as long as you don't sleep all afternoon) and though I didn't make much use of the LCD TV or microwave I did appreciate the choice of a hot shower and full size fridge. Hotel security is robust; they will never let anyone pass reception without your prior sanction. It's also worth mentioning that I never used the safe once and I left my laptop on the desk in my room for the whole stay. While the distance to the main hotspots in central Pattaya may not suit everyone it gave me the excuse to jump on the back of a bike taxi at every opportunity and the location does offer some respite from the non-stop activity down Walking Street, Beach Road and Soi 6. There is also some local entertainment just a few hundred metres from the hotel that is worth sampling. If I had to say what I liked the least it would probably be that the Bar was only installing a pool table on the day I was leaving, otherwise I'd probably have spent some more time there.",SUKHOTAI RESORT PATTAYA - Prices & Lodge Reviews (Thailand),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.907640,100.882263&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.907640,100.882263&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.906674,100.877853|12.908383,100.892921|12.905225,100.877312|12.905161,100.882828|12.906600,100.878822|12.905026,100.877380|12.907640,100.882263|12.905974,100.882736|12.908949,100.891106&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.913368,100.873314|12.905355,100.873077|12.915799,100.886353|12.911740,100.880096|12.916827,100.879189|12.910579,100.873123|12.906291,100.876801|12.911975,100.880020|12.910710,100.872566&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.910244,100.874542|12.910260,100.874184|12.901575,100.873116|12.900847,100.874405|12.910868,100.872353|12.902781,100.874138|12.912800,100.873619|12.908669,100.881470|12.901670,100.873016&signature=Ds2kYNGU8Re7LWNuAhJ9dDjEx_Y="
intuitive_007 wrote a review Jan 2014,20,A hotel that finds guests to be a disruption,"The check in process took more than 3/4 of an hour. There was no other customers at reception. We booked 2 rooms. We were allocated two rooms next to reception and it was very noisy. The rooms are new but the bathroom is not well cleaned. The rooms had a general unpleasant horrible odour (drainage problem). There were 7 people(us counted!) at reception at any given time. Most just stood around with the manager allocating rooms etc. On expressing our disgust at the odour, they sprayed the rooms saying there were no other rooms available. In one of the rooms, telephone and bedside table was missing. An old dusty telephone was installed upon request. The hotel itself is away from any happenning spots but shuttle service(free) is advertised on the internet. On the night of check in the driver dropped us to requested marketplace with reluctance.  The next day, we walked across open drains and makeshift kitchen to their dining area for breakfast. Apart from the hot dishes, the flies seem to be resident on all other dishes especially the fruit platter(could have been easily remedied with a cover). The hot dishes were good and the cook and his assistant(the short one) were the only people attempting to provide some sort of service.  The hotel has a swimming pool whereupon my husband was regarded with suspicion when he was swimming! The second day some people were enjoying with drinks by the poolside. After spending the first night at the hotel and staying in our room(no facilities), we asked the hotel to drop us at central festival, we were asked to wait even though the hotel had shown us a sign which clearly stated that the shuttle made 2 trips to Jomtein beach and central festival at 11am and 4pm.(deviation from website advertisement).  The next day, after staying in our room for the whole day, and telling reception we would like to be dropped at central festival at 4, we were asked by Riza (at reception) whether we would like shuttle surcharge to pay upfront or put on our room. She was appallingly rude. We pointed out that this was a free service advertised. She said if we expected service we should go to 5 star hotel. After a few heated words at discrepancies, she ran off screaming with the shuttle driver hiding in the next room.  The manager tried to explain, saying the surcharge is because of high season. We said we want to check out as suggested by Riza. We did, got them to call Agoda to refund our money. Agoda still hasn't refunded the new year's surcharge they still keeping. Lucky for us we moved to a fantastic hotel from there!!  Everything seemed like a huge problem and definately not a family hotel. I would never this hotel to anyone.

marrmr wrote a review Sep 2013,50,A Gem In Jomtiem!!.. Highly Recommend!!,"Had a months stay in thes new hotel/serviced apartment and was fantastic. From the brand new rooms with not just one but two Sony flat screen TV's in the living room (with Sony home entertainment system and DVD player) and one in the bedroom. Jazzucci in the bathroom and beautifull bedrooms. Has a great pool and spotlessly clean and a bar and restaurant with great and reasonably priced food... Well located in a nice quiet area just 50yds of one of the main streets..... but a special mention to the staff, especially the management. I arrived with a minor problem with my booking, which was the fault of the company we booked through and she sorted it out with no problem and went that extra mile to make sure we were absoluctly happy.. So thanks to her and the rest of the staff and owner of this fantastic residence...
