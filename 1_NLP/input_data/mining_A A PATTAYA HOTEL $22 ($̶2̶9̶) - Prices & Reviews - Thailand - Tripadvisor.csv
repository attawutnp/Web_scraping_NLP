LewisH wrote a review Jan 2019,20,Location - but that is it!!,"So.. this hotel is a perfect location overlooking the beach and is only a 10 minute walk to Walking Street. The pool offers views over the beach and is a nice place to catch some sun in the afternoon. Compared to other places around this hotel is ALLOT cheaper which was attractive when booking.    I would suggest if you are booking primarily to be out all night drinking then this is a good hotel for you.    The music from next door “Hooters” and other bars goes off until 2am every night which is when they close, and is very loud as the windows are not double glazed. The room was small and despite being clean as a first appearance at night ALL of the bugs come out. Me and my partner were very close to booking another hotel to stay in, however decided against it in the end due to the costs involved.

Glen-Johnson-Author wrote a review Jan 2018,40,Perfect Location.,"I have been to Pattaya 6 times with my girlfriend and we always stay here. The staff are great, and the location is perfect. The only hotel in the area with a pool on the 4th floor overlooking the beach, and Beach Road. If you want that anywhere else along the beach you will be paying five times the price. And some people mention the overweight men around the pool - you got to remember, this is Pattaya, they are everywhere. You do get some music from Hooters next door, but normally stops around midnight, and if you're in Pattaya, and in your room at midnight, then maybe you shouldn't be here, lol. Also, the wi-fi is one of the fastest I've had at any hotel. I live in Bangkok, so it's only two hours away, and we go here because even though Pattaya has a bad reputation regarding the sex trade, it also has an amazing beach and collection of islands, and two large malls, as well as a floating market and many other great days out.",A A PATTAYA HOTEL $22 ($̶2̶9̶) - Prices & Reviews - Thailand - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.895030,100.875320&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.895030,100.875320&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.891585,100.874062|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.892040,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.894398,100.874542|12.894528,100.871063|12.896873,100.871773|12.894320,100.874474&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.892222,100.876945|12.891152,100.875732|12.891460,100.876312|12.893725,100.873589|12.894181,100.871368|12.894294,100.874367|12.897381,100.874458|12.890904,100.874466|12.894560,100.871880&signature=2ZTHxQTR33sgTLhVev-eB_vXP00="

JayDhar wrote a review Feb 2014,20,Just A/C & HOTWATER,"Just finished 2 nights at this hotel. The only good thing about the hotel is the rooms has uninterrupted a/c and hotwater. Rooms are small and the bathrooms is horrible. Starting from the reception, ""0"" customer service and PR, which you do not expect in Pattaya area anyway. Agent has paid for room with breakfast, however, since most people get room only, the reception never read the voucher and gave us a realy hard time during breakfast. On top of that, the breakfast was only 2 slices of bread, 2 not properly done bullseys eggs, coffee, orange juice and few crum fried unedible bacon slices on both days.    One more + point is that the hotel is just few steps away fm the beach and the beach road. The most unbearable incident is by 4 to 5 pm everyday a lady comes with water and knock on your door irrespective of whether you are a sleep or not and say "" Hello Waterrrrrr"". Doesn't really matter if you say it is inconvenient for you.    If you are looking for a place, there are plenty outside with all you can eat buffett. Rooms starting from 700 Baht and 150 for Buffett.

Pool on the roof is a great bonus and you can have drinks and meals by the pool.  Clean rooms and reception/ hall carpets need replacing but for the price can't complain.

C130Captain wrote a review Jan 2012,30,Budget Hotel good for overnight but not for classic beach vacation,"I usually stay here because of the central location whenever I stay for 1 or max 2 nights. Even though right in the middle of everything, the hotel is fairly quiet. Rooms are old and furnished very basic. Some of the rooms have a great view onto the bay. Basically, you get what you pay for. The average rate at the reception is 1000 THB in the high season, which seems to be somewhat standard in Pattaya, while I heard that there is better places available for the price while not that centrally located. No in room safes but safe deposit boxes are available at the reception. The beach in the high season is everything but nice and clean. Packed up with beach chairs and sun covers all the way to the water line. Bottom line: Good budget hotel for short stays at a central location but not suited for families or a long term beach vacation.",A A PATTAYA HOTEL $22 ($̶2̶9̶) - Prices & Reviews - Thailand - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.895030,100.875320&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.895030,100.875320&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.891585,100.874062|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.892040,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.894398,100.874542|12.894528,100.871063|12.896873,100.871773|12.894320,100.874474&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.892222,100.876945|12.891152,100.875732|12.891460,100.876312|12.893725,100.873589|12.894181,100.871368|12.894294,100.874367|12.897381,100.874458|12.890904,100.874466|12.894560,100.871880&signature=2ZTHxQTR33sgTLhVev-eB_vXP00="
GillianJhb wrote a review Jan 2012,30,Value for money if you make an informed choice,"I chose this hotel based on its location, price - which allowed us to book a seaview suite - and the view of the beach from the pool area. The first day or two after arriving we wrent sure we had made a wise decision and considered moving but in the end the pros outweighed the cons as far as we were concerned. However this is NOT a hotel for families or for a couple looking for a romantic holiday. It is budget accomodation with a brilliant location and views.  I am going to post pictures so you will be able to see that the hotel is rather 'tired' in some areas. Indeed areas like the carpets in the passages and the pool lounger cushions are in a very bad condition. Our bathroom also was somewhat mismatched and the towels in the room were threadbare (and limited to one per person.)  But that aside - the room was spacious and clean (if in need of some paint). The pool did deliver the view (altho no shade from about 1-30pm). Breakfasts were well presented and for 75 Baht you got two fried eggs, 2 pieces of toast, bacon, jam, coffee and orange juice.  The guests were primarily men, some on their own, some with their Thai ladies. We were two western ladies travelling together but didnt feel unwelcome in any way.  Basically we found you get what you pay for - and in terms of location, room (not bathroom) and views - we were satisfied with our choice. Most of the staff were very obliging but this is more likely family run than anything and the facilities and services are not based on what you find in hotel chains. For example - not only wasnt there a hairdryer in the room - there wasnt one to borrow from reception. (No safes in the room either but that is probably not going to be a deciding factor - there are safety deposit boxes downstairs.)  There is one lift - looking a little sad, but it did its job and with rooms to the 7th floor at least - its very necessary.",A A PATTAYA HOTEL $22 ($̶2̶9̶) - Prices & Reviews - Thailand - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.895030,100.875320&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.895030,100.875320&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.891585,100.874062|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.892040,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.894398,100.874542|12.894528,100.871063|12.896873,100.871773|12.894320,100.874474&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.892222,100.876945|12.891152,100.875732|12.891460,100.876312|12.893725,100.873589|12.894181,100.871368|12.894294,100.874367|12.897381,100.874458|12.890904,100.874466|12.894560,100.871880&signature=2ZTHxQTR33sgTLhVev-eB_vXP00="

BaltimoreMae wrote a review Mar 2009,10,can you hum a tune?: La Cucaracha dee deee dee deee...,"Unbeatable beachfront location in the heart of everything and the most wonderful, trustworthy, helpful, and friendly staff (from front office, bellmen, and housekeeping) you could ever desire. However, there is a fatal flaw to this property. It is overrun with cockroaches. Although there is monthly professional pest control, the adult and baby roaches are everywhere, and they are present in large numbers on ALL floors and ALL rooms. I got tired of smushing the dozen or so cockroaches about the room every time upon entering, so I would capture them in a wad of toilet paper and give them a spiraling raft ride down the commode, and eventually progressed to blowing them one by one with a puff of air from my lungs from the bathroom vanity into the commode like a field goal kicker. The pillows smelled like an ashtray. This hotel is WAY overdue for a renovation. It needs all mattresses replaced and a serious, serious fumigation during a short term property shutdown. Current pest control measures do nothing as the spraying isn't reaching their lairs in the ceilings and walls. I was worried about transporting roach eggs back with me on personal effects. Beautiful 4th floor seaview swimming pool that is tiny and the water is cloudy. Black mold is pervasive on the grout of the shower tub walls. English TV channel availability is pitiful compared to nearby hotels.

Saparks wrote a review Sep 2007,50,Great for the price,I stayed at the AA Pattaya Hotel (the one closest to Beach Road) for several months. Although it was not the nicest hotel in Pattaya it was a very good hotel. I never had one thing come up missing and all the services were very acceptable. The front desk personnel were super nice and I had a great time staying in Pattaya. The maids and wait staff were excellent and always helpful. While I was there they were updating the Carpeting in several of the rooms and the hotel sprayed for insects regularly.(As is the case in tropical climates) When I return to Pattaya I will try to stay at AA again. The Jewelry Store there is very nice also.

UncutDiamond wrote a review Feb 2007,10,Dreadful & Cheats!!,"Dear reader,    I recently stayed at the named hotel with two other friends and may I say this is a hotel to be avoided at all costs. I stayed at this hotel for a period of eight days and when I arrived the staff were pleasent explained everything to us. However, as days went on we began to have poor experiences of this place which changed are view. While Pattaya is known for its wild nights there were certain standards that were unacceptable.    Firstly I noticed very young girls less than 16 years of age being let in with elderly men in their rooms for the obvious reasons. Although this is illegal this hotel seemed to have overlooked this matter for its regular customers. This was very sickening with gave me a bitter taste of this hotel. I informed the hotel staff who said that it happens and that they had to look after their customers and often ignore what goes on.    As days went on I found that hotel room was infested with tiny red ants and insects and on part of the room I found a nest. I was refused a refund or another room and had to pay the cleaner extra on the side to remove the nest.    Few days later I had my safe key stolen by the staff which was kept in a hidden place inside the room. It did not occur to me why someone would do this as there was a clear record of who accessed the safe. When i informed the staff at the hotel i was told that I had to pay 3000 Bahts for a replacement key. I had no choice but to pay this as I was threatened with police if i did not pay. My friend the following day also found his key taken and he to had paid 3000 baht. The pattern became very obvious. The cleaners and staff tend to take the key and the staff then charge the guests for the money which they pocket and once the guest leaves they make the key available again for the next guest. My friend speaks the language but the staff were unaware of this and he heard the conversation in my presence as they laughed at us thinking that we did not know. One staff said this is a regular earner!    My last experience was when i gave in clothes for laundry and found that they had shrunk when they were returned to me. These were very expensive socks and garments and when I asked to be compensated for the damage I was told that they would not do it but will not charge me for the laundry. When i said this was unacceptable I was told that they would call the police and ensure that I do not board my plane the following day which I clearly could not afford to do.    People I would avoid this hotel at every costs and more so if you have a family. Do not keep your safe key in the room or give anything for laundry. It is not worth it as there as much cheaper and nice hotels around closer to walking street.
