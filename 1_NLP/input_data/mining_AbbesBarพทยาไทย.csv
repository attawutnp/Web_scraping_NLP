One of the worst bars on Walking St,มี.ค. ค.ศ. 2016 • เพื่อนๆ,This bar is usually empty because of the volume of the music in the place is unbearable. It has no real theme or style. Occasionally drunk male tourists dance around a pole. The last time I went in they were playing some decent music but one of the bar girls stopped the music to put on some dreadful hip hop or rap.,AbbesBarพทยาไทย,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.attraction_review&zoom=14&size=416x722&scale=2&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=th_TH&center=12.926100,100.872581&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-standard.png|scale:2|12.926171,100.872726|12.925980,100.876183|12.927482,100.876144|12.929736,100.877899|12.925700,100.867790&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-active-anchor.png|scale:2|12.926100,100.872581&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Frestaurants-standard.png|scale:2|12.923672,100.873116|12.927536,100.876404|12.927078,100.874031|12.928334,100.876518|12.930322,100.878181&map_id=c01884c8146ad115&signature=uhQlYgwGMiWKwKRTFJuPOYg7wQo="
My favourite bar in the world,ก.พ. ค.ศ. 2016,"21 years and counting. Before when I lived in England and then in Hong Kong and Singapore. The oldest Thai family owned music bar on Walking Street, no hassle, spend all night people watching, playing any song you want and loud when you want it. Rock, punk, indie, motown, disco, hip hop from Oasis, The Jam, the Who, Led Zeppelin, Primal Scream, The Smiths, Prince, Foo Fighters, Jay Z, Abba, Smokey Robinson, St Vincent, Grimes, Kendrick Lamar -not like any bar on the street. A place for music lovers, unpretentious and not out to impress anyone.",AbbesBarพทยาไทย,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.attraction_review&zoom=14&size=416x722&scale=2&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=th_TH&center=12.926100,100.872581&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-standard.png|scale:2|12.926171,100.872726|12.925980,100.876183|12.927482,100.876144|12.929736,100.877899|12.925700,100.867790&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-active-anchor.png|scale:2|12.926100,100.872581&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Frestaurants-standard.png|scale:2|12.923672,100.873116|12.927536,100.876404|12.927078,100.874031|12.928334,100.876518|12.930322,100.878181&map_id=c01884c8146ad115&signature=uhQlYgwGMiWKwKRTFJuPOYg7wQo="

great music & friendly happy girls,มี.ค. ค.ศ. 2015 • เดินทางคนเดียว,"Really good friendly happy vibe in this bar, played great music & DJ down the back happy to take requests.
First night I visited the bottled coke was wrong so I bought my own from 7/11 & they just charged for the spirits, I only planned to stay for one drink, 5 hours later ....

Arguably Pattaya's best indie/alternative bar,ธ.ค. ค.ศ. 2014 • เพื่อนๆ,"I've visited Abbe's bar numerous times on each visit to Pattaya. Last time was eary hours in the morning of New Years' day, where along with everyone else myself and my Thai girlfriend and her friends were engaged in silly string and foam fights with other revellers at the bar.

Abbe's is a hassle free bar which typically plays indie, alternative and rock music that's why I am a patron. Stone Roses, AC/DC, Kaiser Chiefs, Rolling Stones go side by side. They are not adverse to playing the odd pop-dance song either to keep the upbeat happy tempo up.

The majority of music is alternative and they are always open to requests for music to listen to whilst you sit and drink. I've often found that the clientele are keen music lovers and open to chats about music.

Good times had and always will be.",AbbesBarพทยาไทย,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.attraction_review&zoom=14&size=416x722&scale=2&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=th_TH&center=12.926100,100.872581&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-standard.png|scale:2|12.926171,100.872726|12.925980,100.876183|12.927482,100.876144|12.929736,100.877899|12.925700,100.867790&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Fattractions-active-anchor.png|scale:2|12.926100,100.872581&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Ffusion_map%2Fv2%2Frestaurants-standard.png|scale:2|12.923672,100.873116|12.927536,100.876404|12.927078,100.874031|12.928334,100.876518|12.930322,100.878181&map_id=c01884c8146ad115&signature=uhQlYgwGMiWKwKRTFJuPOYg7wQo="
