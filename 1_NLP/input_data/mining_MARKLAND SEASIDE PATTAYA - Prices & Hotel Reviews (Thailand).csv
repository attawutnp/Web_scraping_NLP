Tracey M wrote a review Sep 2018,10,Really not great,"Huge room and great balcony view.

Pravesh Goyal wrote a review Jan 2018,30,Only best part is Sea View rooms but need renovation urgently,"We have stayed in this hotel last week. This ia big building of 26 floors but rooms are only from 7th to 10th floor. The only good thing in this hotel is the Sea view rooms and also the location which is near to beach for water sports etc. The rooms are in bed condition and need major renovation. Furniture is old mattress are not of good sleep quality. Bathrooms also need a major changes and modern amenities. For each and anything you need to call reception. Strange part is that in pattaya kind of place where you go to beach they wont allow you a second towel in your room and will ask money for that.    The corridor is very wide but need a overhaul renovation to make it good. The pool was good but no life guard there.    Breakfast was below average for the vegetarians and if salad, fruit, corn flacks not there you cant survive. you get at least 8-10 items but all with meat or fish or like that. When you have so many indian tourists coming then why cant they keep at least one veg item    wifi connectivity was very bad in rooms and they dont even have a adapter to use 3 pin top in their 2 pic socket.    in this same budget you can get better rooms in that area and if they renovate it will benefit to them",MARKLAND SEASIDE PATTAYA - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Thailand),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.946652,100.885010&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.946652,100.885010&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.946860,100.884850|12.945836,100.889351|12.947358,100.889198|12.945370,100.887077|12.946270,100.886261&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.945942,100.888512|12.945222,100.886719|12.945535,100.885284|12.945942,100.888336|12.947791,100.885063|12.945237,100.886757|12.947760,100.884895|12.945852,100.888542|12.947489,100.884918&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.945731,100.888847|12.947556,100.885757|12.948326,100.885590|12.950534,100.885422|12.945615,100.885139|12.944045,100.887093|12.944705,100.888603&signature=E8iDt-osN8_Oe0fJbhV7xDk23r8="

sanhatig2015 wrote a review Mar 2017,30,Location is the only plus,"I stayed at The Mark Land Boutique Hotel from March 17th to 20th, 2017 with two of my sisters. We booked a suite with sea view. On arrival, room 723 was allotted to us which had its wooden flooring broken and in places it was caving in. We immediately asked for a change in a similar room in upper floors. We were told no other suite room is available. When I made booking 2 months earlier - why not a better room would have been reserved for me - the receptionist has no answer for it? With some bit of argument - we were given an identical suite room right opposite 723 and the flooring and condition of this room was perfectly fine! Then why this room (no. 726) was not given to us in the first instance?? Does the management think it's ok to take the Indian travelers for granted??    The newly allotted room - 726 was fine - large rooms with lot of natural light. The view from the balcony was nice. Beds were comfortable. But the room has become dated and needs a complete overhaul. The corridor is shabby and so is the service. The house keeping lady leaves the trolley right at the middle of the lobby. I also had a feeling that in the entire 7th floor we three ladies were the only occupants. There were plenty of Europeans staying in the hotel and they were all given accommodation at the upper floors. We, overall, had the feeling of being discriminated at.    We did not try the hotel restaurant. Breakfast was quite average.    One or probably only positive is the location - close to beach road and close to Tiffany and Alcazer shows. But it is far from the Walking Street.    Will I recommend the hotel to others? NO - you can find a better hotel and better hospitality in the similar price range.",MARKLAND SEASIDE PATTAYA - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Thailand),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.946652,100.885010&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.946652,100.885010&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.946860,100.884850|12.945836,100.889351|12.947358,100.889198|12.945370,100.887077|12.946270,100.886261&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.945942,100.888512|12.945222,100.886719|12.945535,100.885284|12.945942,100.888336|12.947791,100.885063|12.945237,100.886757|12.947760,100.884895|12.945852,100.888542|12.947489,100.884918&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.945731,100.888847|12.947556,100.885757|12.948326,100.885590|12.950534,100.885422|12.945615,100.885139|12.944045,100.887093|12.944705,100.888603&signature=E8iDt-osN8_Oe0fJbhV7xDk23r8="

Rooms are great as I was upgraded which a treat.  The hairdresser next to the hotel is excellent. Make sure to have a visit as the lady is really nice. All in all the hotel is perfectly located from all the hustle and bustle but can be easily be accessed via a simple songthaew ride.

DavisR69 wrote a review Nov 2014,40,Worth the money,"This is the Mark Land Boutique Hotel in North Pattaya that has its front entrance off a side road from Beach Road. All rooms have a sea view which is very refreshing and one of the features that makes this a value for money purchase. Deals are available from the front desk and it would be worth bartering when enquiring online. During my stay, the hotel did not appear to busy although a number of the floors are occupied by condos, owned mainly by relocated expats.    The room I stayed in was a good size and looked as if it had also originally been intended as a condo purchase, as suggested by a small kitchenette area that included a sink and non functioning hobs. There was also plenty of cupboard space.    The staff was very friendly and helpful, particularly in the restaurant and Tik at reception. Breakfast is included and provides a good range of western and Thai alternatives.    In the room itself the reception on the TV could have been better on certain channels and too many of the movie channels were tuned in for Thai language and not English, as in most Pattaya hotels. The room safe did not function so one at reception was available. Tea and coffee making facilities were available.    In general, the rooms were clean although on the odd occasion (over a 20 day stay) my room could have been cleaned more thoroughly.    A two minute walk from reception to Beach Road avails one of a plethora of taxis and baht buses, heading to Central and South Pattaya. So on the way to Walking Street transport will pass The Hard Rock Cafe, Central Festival Shopping Centre and Mike Mall to name but a few of popular tourist attractions in the area.    Although there may be more salubrious hotels in North Pattaya, they are also more expensive. The Mark Land Boutique Hotel does provide a quiet, decent and value for money option.",MARKLAND SEASIDE PATTAYA - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Thailand),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.946652,100.885010&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.946652,100.885010&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.946860,100.884850|12.945836,100.889351|12.947358,100.889198|12.945370,100.887077|12.946270,100.886261&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.945942,100.888512|12.945222,100.886719|12.945535,100.885284|12.945942,100.888336|12.947791,100.885063|12.945237,100.886757|12.947760,100.884895|12.945852,100.888542|12.947489,100.884918&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.945731,100.888847|12.947556,100.885757|12.948326,100.885590|12.950534,100.885422|12.945615,100.885139|12.944045,100.887093|12.944705,100.888603&signature=E8iDt-osN8_Oe0fJbhV7xDk23r8="

pspk_26 wrote a review May 2013,40,Awesome location and good value!,"This hotel was booked by my travel agent and I was in for a great surprise when I found that it is located right in front of the beach! Not only that, it is quite the prime area too. Quite a variety of shopping places and restaurants around too. The service was pretty okish... The 2:00 PM check-in time is a bit harsh I would say, especially when most Indians would arrive as early as 3 AM to Bangkok and by 6 AM to Pattaya. We had to wait in the lobby for about 6 hours and finally got an early check in option... The restaurant has limited variety in their breakfast menu, but the view from your table would be breathtaking, that you'd forget about what goes inside to your stomach :P The rooms were good and were maintained well.

Britishaustralians wrote a review Feb 2013,20,Do not stay here!!!,"Unfortunately the staff are all unfriendly, no toilet paper, had to keep Asking for it. Rooms are clean however a bit of bleach would not go astray. The pool is self serve, no pool bar or pool boy to help with the sun lounges, the stench in the pool/ gym area is unbelievable, dont get me wrong we have stayed in varies places in pattaya in the last 10 years and this really takes the cake. Make sure you bring your own pool towels as none are supplied you get yelled at there by the German residents as they think they own the pool, best to just go across the road to the beach. The noise is totally unbearable with other guests in the hotel they have no consideration for others at all hours of the night, with their paid companions arguing over monies due, on two occasions we had to ask them to please be quiet. The hotel it self is in a very good position, however very old and rundown. For the money there are far better hotels in Pattaya. The breakfast on the 27th floor is very poor, no air conditioning in the whole building only in your room. Overall poor value for money.

Thailand00 wrote a review Jan 2013,30,Good Location but why are the staff so rude?,"I stayed in a private apartment so I can only review the areas which are common to the private condos and the hotel:  + a good location close to the beach, bars and restaurants  + The view from the upper floors is spectacular  + There is a restaurant on top of the building serving both Thai and western food – I found it amazing that the “American” breakfast didn’t have bacon.  + The pool was attractive and because of the climate, generally warm  + Generally very quiet  + Street food is very close, very cheap and very good  - The staff in the Lobby were incredibly rude and unhelpful – they would not even exchange a 100 baht bill for smaller bills for use on a baht bus - the money was right there in a drawer. Other staff at the pool and the security area were friendly and polite.  - The gym was a joke, more than half the equipment was broken or not fit for purpose.

Hamid S wrote a review Jan 2013,20,The only plus is view,If you are from that type of person who care about staff behavior I will strongly recommend you that never go to this hotel . Besides the rooms are terribly messy and I found cockroach there for more than 2 or 3 times .The only positive thing in this hotel is its view from restaurant and pool .,MARKLAND SEASIDE PATTAYA - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Thailand),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.946652,100.885010&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.946652,100.885010&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.946860,100.884850|12.945836,100.889351|12.947358,100.889198|12.945370,100.887077|12.946270,100.886261&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.945942,100.888512|12.945222,100.886719|12.945535,100.885284|12.945942,100.888336|12.947791,100.885063|12.945237,100.886757|12.947760,100.884895|12.945852,100.888542|12.947489,100.884918&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.945731,100.888847|12.947556,100.885757|12.948326,100.885590|12.950534,100.885422|12.945615,100.885139|12.944045,100.887093|12.944705,100.888603&signature=E8iDt-osN8_Oe0fJbhV7xDk23r8="
Bkkmegabob wrote a review Dec 2012,20,Breakfast with a stunning view on 27 floor,"We stayed in this hotel because of its location on the beach at the quieter North end of the seafront. I got my desired sea view from a spacious balcony. This hotel is on floors 7-10 in a 27 storey block of Condos - if fails to be either a hotel or condo. We stayed in a suite room for 2500 baht a night and it was a huge clean room, much more like a studio room with 2 huge beds and plenty of space with a kitchen area. Breakfast on the 27 floor holds a stunning view well worth a visit even if you are not staying in the hotel. The service however lets this hotel down, for some reason you get no toilet paper in the room and on questioning the lady boy at reception you get a very poor couldn’t care less attitude. During our stay it was full of travellers from the Indian continent that might go some way to explaining the service and treatment at reception.",MARKLAND SEASIDE PATTAYA - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Thailand),"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.946652,100.885010&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.946652,100.885010&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.946860,100.884850|12.945836,100.889351|12.947358,100.889198|12.945370,100.887077|12.946270,100.886261&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.945942,100.888512|12.945222,100.886719|12.945535,100.885284|12.945942,100.888336|12.947791,100.885063|12.945237,100.886757|12.947760,100.884895|12.945852,100.888542|12.947489,100.884918&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.945731,100.888847|12.947556,100.885757|12.948326,100.885590|12.950534,100.885422|12.945615,100.885139|12.944045,100.887093|12.944705,100.888603&signature=E8iDt-osN8_Oe0fJbhV7xDk23r8="
