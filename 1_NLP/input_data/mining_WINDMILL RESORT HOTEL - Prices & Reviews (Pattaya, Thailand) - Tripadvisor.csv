Siam-G wrote a review Oct 2019,20,smelly room no window but great stuff .,Nice and friendly people working here.  The bad things here is first we paid for rooms with city view but rooms we got had only window to our toilet. rooms where dark with no windows and very bad smell of septics. we asked to change the rooms and first they spray the rooms and it didn't help so got change the rooms but we had to pay extra for that so we paid 200 baht for each remaining nights for what we actually had paid already for .,"WINDMILL RESORT HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971916,100.904854&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971916,100.904854&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.973813,100.906319|12.973932,100.907280|12.967360,100.899460|12.971680,100.904800|12.969510,100.906929|12.972208,100.912155&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.969304,100.895462|12.978675,100.911247|12.978750,100.911346|12.968847,100.901031|12.969087,100.895523|12.967360,100.899460|12.974465,100.907814|12.969820,100.904823|12.973379,100.909355&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.974410,100.908669|12.969748,100.899918|12.970997,100.895470|12.972500,100.893929|12.962568,100.909744|12.968396,100.895966|12.975434,100.913986|12.971354,100.893837&signature=xMeKMSz1QhXWlbA07sOUKyMjXGE="
gunzle wrote a review May 2019,30,Not a bad budget,"Moved to this hotel because Loma Hotel was worse than awful. Not a bad budget hotel, staff at reception were lovely and helpful, room fine. Little bar at pool, comfy seats there also to relax in if you get fed up of sun lounges. No tea coffee in room, but we went down the road for breakfast, and girl behind bar at pool will get you a coffee if you ask. Away from main road so no noise which is a bonus.

Tom S wrote a review Feb 2019,40,An oasis of tranquillity.,"In the midst of the bustle (and hustle) of Pattaya this hotel offers a welcome poolside respite form the outside action.

The hotel rooms are adequate with a double bed and a large single, tv, safe, large closet, and balcony. The rooms are cleaned daily although the bedding is not.  The location is fairly busy with all the pubs, bars, massage, shops, dentists, drug stores, vehicle rent, barbers/hairdressers, although not as busy as beach road leading to walking street.  The baht bus passes along the road frequently to central pattaya, so it is not a problem getting to and from the area.

Tom S wrote a review Mar 2016,40,What a gem!,"This gem of a hotel offers a cool oasis in the frenetic buzz of life in Pattaya. The room was excellent, and superbly serviced. The salad dishes on the menus were plentiful and fresh daily. Breakfast had the most extensive choice I personally have come across.  Bad news about the local taxis is that they have suspended the ""meter"" system. too tiresome to haggle every time you have to go on a journey, so songthaew system is still best for getting around.  Lack of a gym was a drawback but back on the good side some sound legal advice and assistance was delivered by a front desk manager whose English language skills were excellent.","WINDMILL RESORT HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971916,100.904854&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971916,100.904854&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.973813,100.906319|12.973932,100.907280|12.967360,100.899460|12.971680,100.904800|12.969510,100.906929|12.972208,100.912155&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.969304,100.895462|12.978675,100.911247|12.978750,100.911346|12.968847,100.901031|12.969087,100.895523|12.967360,100.899460|12.974465,100.907814|12.969820,100.904823|12.973379,100.909355&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.974410,100.908669|12.969748,100.899918|12.970997,100.895470|12.972500,100.893929|12.962568,100.909744|12.968396,100.895966|12.975434,100.913986|12.971354,100.893837&signature=xMeKMSz1QhXWlbA07sOUKyMjXGE="
Homeboynot wrote a review Dec 2015,20,Don't stay here,"Most of the time there was no hot water for the shower. The sink only has a single faucet with cold water. The room was windowless although the bathroom had windows. The place is old and worn out and there is no elevator. They do have a nice looking lobby and entrance from the street so the place looks good at first but the room was basically awful. They have a very nice swimming pool and the included breakfast is spartan but OK. They will do omelets at breakfast but no cheese! As is normal in Pataya it's more or less in a red light district but there are plenty of nice places to eat on the street in front of the hotel and it's a major street. Taxis are very expensive in Pataya so learn to take the ""pickup truck"" buses to get around when you can. The blue bus is the one on the street you will use to come and go. The hotel staff will go out on the street with you to tell the driver where you want to go. These buses cost basically nothing but they will try to make you pay a lot more if you let them so make sure the price is right before you board. Down by the massage place on the ground floor they sell cokes for only 15 baht! Good deal!","WINDMILL RESORT HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971916,100.904854&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971916,100.904854&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.973813,100.906319|12.973932,100.907280|12.967360,100.899460|12.971680,100.904800|12.969510,100.906929|12.972208,100.912155&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.969304,100.895462|12.978675,100.911247|12.978750,100.911346|12.968847,100.901031|12.969087,100.895523|12.967360,100.899460|12.974465,100.907814|12.969820,100.904823|12.973379,100.909355&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.974410,100.908669|12.969748,100.899918|12.970997,100.895470|12.972500,100.893929|12.962568,100.909744|12.968396,100.895966|12.975434,100.913986|12.971354,100.893837&signature=xMeKMSz1QhXWlbA07sOUKyMjXGE="

Carl R wrote a review Feb 2015,10,cheap for a reason,"If you buy a drink at the 7/11 or family mart and drink it around the pool, you will be approached for a 300 baht charge, but this only seems to happen if you are from England or Australia, pool is dirty, staff don't understand you when it is convenient, food is poor, staff that do understand English are patronising, the hotel is feels like there are many traps to charge you money, for example there are charges if your bath or beech towels go missing but the first day I had my room cleaned all my towels were gone and I had no clean ones, there is what looks like an ashtray in the toilet but if you leave a fag in it you will be charged 1000 baht, this hotel with small changes could be good but it is badly managed. The tables around the pool are very dirty, I have been to pattaya about 12 times I have stayed in cheap hotels 50% of the time as I will be on a budget I don't expect extra charges constantly, eventually I refused to spend any money in the hotel on it's services which means ultimately the hotel lost out due to it's hidden costs.","WINDMILL RESORT HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971916,100.904854&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971916,100.904854&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.973813,100.906319|12.973932,100.907280|12.967360,100.899460|12.971680,100.904800|12.969510,100.906929|12.972208,100.912155&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.969304,100.895462|12.978675,100.911247|12.978750,100.911346|12.968847,100.901031|12.969087,100.895523|12.967360,100.899460|12.974465,100.907814|12.969820,100.904823|12.973379,100.909355&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.974410,100.908669|12.969748,100.899918|12.970997,100.895470|12.972500,100.893929|12.962568,100.909744|12.968396,100.895966|12.975434,100.913986|12.971354,100.893837&signature=xMeKMSz1QhXWlbA07sOUKyMjXGE="

Almost all the guest likes talking to her and asking for some help, she was very helpful i've seen that she also help one of the guest who fall down because of too much drinking.

Magellan2014 wrote a review Apr 2014,20,A hotel badly in need of renovation,"The reception area with its rusting security boxes behind the reception desk shows this is an old hotel badly in need of renovation. My room, a good size, but was also very dated in a strange green colour with matching painted refrigerator (horrible).    The bathroom was on the whole outside wall of the hotel with an internal window to allow some natural light, very odd design.    A special mention of the main staircase where some of the steps are of an uneven height, even I tripped up on them and I am an active man. The staircase to the top floor is barred with a metal barrier because you can see that the hotel was never finished.    The swimming pool area is actually quite pleasant, a good place to relax and it was also nice to have a good breakfast there. Be warned the pool is deep.    I was told that the bedrooms overlooking the pool area have been refurbished and are the best ones in the hotel.    Overall a hotel badly in need of renovation.","WINDMILL RESORT HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971916,100.904854&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971916,100.904854&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.973813,100.906319|12.973932,100.907280|12.967360,100.899460|12.971680,100.904800|12.969510,100.906929|12.972208,100.912155&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.969304,100.895462|12.978675,100.911247|12.978750,100.911346|12.968847,100.901031|12.969087,100.895523|12.967360,100.899460|12.974465,100.907814|12.969820,100.904823|12.973379,100.909355&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.974410,100.908669|12.969748,100.899918|12.970997,100.895470|12.972500,100.893929|12.962568,100.909744|12.968396,100.895966|12.975434,100.913986|12.971354,100.893837&signature=xMeKMSz1QhXWlbA07sOUKyMjXGE="
mickeymau wrote a review May 2013,40,Bace to Windmill,"I came to Windmill first time in 2003 and have spent 2-6 weeks there every year since. What I like most about this place is the big swimmingpool. In my first years, with the priveous manager, I was allowed to bring two ladies to party in the pool around the clock. And in 2012 it was still possible to go for a swim alone at night, whish I like. The present mangager may not be as casual as the previous, but she is a very nice smiling lady who sent a basket of fruit to my room and whished me welcome home when she saw I was a returning costumer. The internet conection is not perfect, but who cares, on a holyday we are not suposed to be atached to a machine. The rooms are old, but clean and perfectly functional. There may not be to much power on the shower, but definitely enough to remain clean every day. And I soon became friend with the friendly maids who did a good job. The reception staff was a bit stiff on my last stay (sep.2012). Especially the youngest girl, but also she smiled from time to time. The greatest person in Windmill is beyond any doubth the belly boy, whish always smile and is up for a good talk, and is very helpful, I really hope he will be there on me my next visit to Windmill.","WINDMILL RESORT HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971916,100.904854&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971916,100.904854&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.973813,100.906319|12.973932,100.907280|12.967360,100.899460|12.971680,100.904800|12.969510,100.906929|12.972208,100.912155&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.969304,100.895462|12.978675,100.911247|12.978750,100.911346|12.968847,100.901031|12.969087,100.895523|12.967360,100.899460|12.974465,100.907814|12.969820,100.904823|12.973379,100.909355&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.974410,100.908669|12.969748,100.899918|12.970997,100.895470|12.972500,100.893929|12.962568,100.909744|12.968396,100.895966|12.975434,100.913986|12.971354,100.893837&signature=xMeKMSz1QhXWlbA07sOUKyMjXGE="
bri_jones wrote a review May 2012,10,very dirty,"We have just returned home after over 2 weeks at this ""resort"". First the good bits the daytime pool menu was quite extensive and very good value, the price of food and drinks didn't differ much from outside bars. That is it !!! The rooms were hardly cleaned during the whole stay even though the maid came in daily. The bedding was appalling when there really was no excuse with the amount of cheap laundries everywhere. The reception staff were not helpful in the least and communication with was impossible I asked for a beer one night and was pointed out to a local bar or the shop across the road, considering there was a wide range of international guests staying the common language seemed to be Thai, The photos are a joke we were staying in a superior room and they certainly didn't match anything we had seen.  My wife wanted to take some photos of the sheets and general decor of the room but I just wanted to forget the whole experience and pretend we had never been there. As you can guess by now I won't be recommended this hotel and if you have booked please cancel and find other accommodation, you have to wonder why they have free cancellations now you know.","WINDMILL RESORT HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971916,100.904854&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971916,100.904854&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.973813,100.906319|12.973932,100.907280|12.967360,100.899460|12.971680,100.904800|12.969510,100.906929|12.972208,100.912155&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.969304,100.895462|12.978675,100.911247|12.978750,100.911346|12.968847,100.901031|12.969087,100.895523|12.967360,100.899460|12.974465,100.907814|12.969820,100.904823|12.973379,100.909355&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.974410,100.908669|12.969748,100.899918|12.970997,100.895470|12.972500,100.893929|12.962568,100.909744|12.968396,100.895966|12.975434,100.913986|12.971354,100.893837&signature=xMeKMSz1QhXWlbA07sOUKyMjXGE="
AaronRR73 wrote a review Mar 2012,40,What no pool !!!,This was my second stay here October 2011. I was booked in a standard room for just under 3 weeks. The Standard rooms are a bit grim but you get what you pay for which does'nt bother me. But on arrival i noticed the pool was out of action. It was for my whole stay. So i managed to get a room upgrade to the deluxe garden rooms. They are a lot better than the standard rooms nice decor and bright. I was very happy with this deal. The staff are friendly and helpful plus they remember me from my last stay. The best rooms are the pool access rooms but are expensive. There are bars and resturants close by on Naklua Road. You can get a taxi (pick up) to walking Street they go past the hotel allday just flag one down. This is a lady friendly hotel so no charge!

NoFishMassage wrote a review Nov 2011,40,Really wanted to give 5 stars but cant,"Cheap, central, clean, friendly staff. Really wanted to give 5 stars particularly with the price to quality thing but I cant. They took our booking knowing the pool was in renovation and would be for a month and we receivid no discount or real sympathy for the inconvenience and when it was 'fixed' it was apparent that the reason it broke in the first place is that it is a chemical pool with no filter so even when it is working, or available, it still is not as good as the pools in other resorts and has bits floating in it.","WINDMILL RESORT HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971916,100.904854&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971916,100.904854&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.973813,100.906319|12.973932,100.907280|12.967360,100.899460|12.971680,100.904800|12.969510,100.906929|12.972208,100.912155&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.969304,100.895462|12.978675,100.911247|12.978750,100.911346|12.968847,100.901031|12.969087,100.895523|12.967360,100.899460|12.974465,100.907814|12.969820,100.904823|12.973379,100.909355&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.974410,100.908669|12.969748,100.899918|12.970997,100.895470|12.972500,100.893929|12.962568,100.909744|12.968396,100.895966|12.975434,100.913986|12.971354,100.893837&signature=xMeKMSz1QhXWlbA07sOUKyMjXGE="

AaronRR73 wrote a review Mar 2011,50,Good Hotel for a good price!,"I stayed for 20 nights in february 2011. They did me a deal because of my long stay, i got a standard room for 600 baht a night instead of the 750 baht charge. The room was fine, plenty of space double bed, sat tv, fridge, aircon which worked great really kept the room cool except when the cleaners turned it off, but is was remote control so u dont have to get out of bed. The bathroom was fine but the shower was not very powerful and it never had hot water at night, i think everbody use the hot water before going out early evening. You also get 2 free bottles of water a day to put in your fridge. I think i was the only english person in the hotel the majority were russian and german and they took all the sunbeds everyday around the pool, so i never used it. But i never got out of bed till the afternoon anyway the cleaners woke me up the first few days then they got used to me and didnt bother again. The walls are thin you can hear the other rooms and the corridor when people come back late at night. This is a lady friendly hotel they do not charge a joiner fee! The staff are very friendly and helpful.

A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Jan 2010,30,Windmill: Nothing special,"This place is very so-so. Nothing bad exactly but...good for older people I think. The rooms had been remodeled and the balcony was OK. The pool area is pretty large. The fron of the hotel is very characterless and lets face it, Naklua isn't the best part of this town. The internet worked sporadically. The staff were OK. The breakfast was the worst-just terrible- but near me there was an older couple wolfing it down and raving about it.","WINDMILL RESORT HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971916,100.904854&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971916,100.904854&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.973813,100.906319|12.973932,100.907280|12.967360,100.899460|12.971680,100.904800|12.969510,100.906929|12.972208,100.912155&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.969304,100.895462|12.978675,100.911247|12.978750,100.911346|12.968847,100.901031|12.969087,100.895523|12.967360,100.899460|12.974465,100.907814|12.969820,100.904823|12.973379,100.909355&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.974410,100.908669|12.969748,100.899918|12.970997,100.895470|12.972500,100.893929|12.962568,100.909744|12.968396,100.895966|12.975434,100.913986|12.971354,100.893837&signature=xMeKMSz1QhXWlbA07sOUKyMjXGE="
