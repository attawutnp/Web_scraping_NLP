Ok rooms, nice pool and garden which occupies by tons of mosquitoes specially at nights. On the webb they offer twin beds which is a lie, they just putt 2 single beds side by side and smiles.  Average breakfast sanctions and serves by military precision with a thai smile. Another peace of bread costs 30 BT. Loudly music turns the breakfast to a horrible start but they turn it of around 9-10 pm, so quiet nights and good sleep.  Nobody talks english but a guy at the night shift.  WiFi? No way.

The rooms decoration is modernize and atmosphere like a youth. We really like the pictures of the rooms. The bed and other facilities are excellent and quite worthy for what you pay. But only one weakness which is there is no door for bath room and toilet. Such a weird room allocation I had ever seen. There is only a curtain for both separate restrooms. They should at least do the slide doors. I share a room with my male senior and we had a problem with that. One have to stay outside while one is using the restrooms. Such a terrible ... !

michwalk62 wrote a review Apr 2016,40,It all depends on who your neighbours are!,"I am happy that I found this hotel as it covered all that I was looking for. The price was very reasonable. The place was modern with some funky decor and the location 3 mins walk from the beach at the quieter end of Jomtien beach. The pool was perfect for sunbathing and swimming (no umbrellas).    Due to the setup of this hotel the rooms are all very close together, so it all depends how courteous your neighbours are. Our first few days were bliss, then a group of 5 Chinese families came along.    One member of staff stands out as being really on the ball and helpful, ensuring that everywhere was being kept clean and directing the others (short hair friendly female). But other staff didn't seem to get the whole customer service thing, with bins overflowing, dead bugs at bottom of pool, messy communal areas.    3 choices for breakfast: fried rice, Khao Tom soup, American (drinks extra)    Rooms: comfy beds, soft sheets. Mini bar. Safe. Hairdryer. Be aware that toilet and shower are behind a curtained door and open onto the bedroom (not much privacy).

D Living is a great choice of hotel if you are looking to enjoy the calm and the peacefulness away from the city. In the center of the hotel there is a swimming pool. During the night time the lights are switch on which create romantic ambiance. The room was big and clean with comfortable bed. Eventho it is far from pattaya but the public pick up truck are available almost anytime and the fee is only THB 20. The beach at Jomtien beach is better then pattaya.

Matteus T wrote a review Feb 2017,30,Simple Ok Budget.,"Clean hotel located close to one of the worst parts of the Jomtien beach. Ok rooms, nice pool and garden which occupies by tons of mosquitoes specially at nights. On the webb they offer twin beds which is a lie, they just putt 2 single beds side by side and smiles.  Average breakfast sanctions and serves by military precision with a thai smile. Another peace of bread costs 30 BT. Loudly music turns the breakfast to a horrible start but they turn it of around 9-10 pm, so quiet nights and good sleep.  Nobody talks english but a guy at the night shift.  WiFi? No way.

khinezarchiwint wrote a review Aug 2016,30,Facilities with the reasonable price,We visited to Pattaya with a group of friends and stayed at D Living. The price is reasonable I guess. The rooms decoration is modernize and atmosphere like a youth. We really like the pictures of the rooms. The bed and other facilities are excellent and quite worthy for what you pay. But only one weakness which is there is no door for bath room and toilet. Such a weird room allocation I had ever seen. There is only a curtain for both separate restrooms. They should at least do the slide doors. I share a room with my male senior and we had a problem with that. One have to stay outside while one is using the restrooms. Such a terrible ... !

michwalk62 wrote a review Apr 2016,40,It all depends on who your neighbours are!,"I am happy that I found this hotel as it covered all that I was looking for. The price was very reasonable. The place was modern with some funky decor and the location 3 mins walk from the beach at the quieter end of Jomtien beach. The pool was perfect for sunbathing and swimming (no umbrellas).    Due to the setup of this hotel the rooms are all very close together, so it all depends how courteous your neighbours are. Our first few days were bliss, then a group of 5 Chinese families came along.    One member of staff stands out as being really on the ball and helpful, ensuring that everywhere was being kept clean and directing the others (short hair friendly female). But other staff didn't seem to get the whole customer service thing, with bins overflowing, dead bugs at bottom of pool, messy communal areas.    3 choices for breakfast: fried rice, Khao Tom soup, American (drinks extra)    Rooms: comfy beds, soft sheets. Mini bar. Safe. Hairdryer. Be aware that toilet and shower are behind a curtained door and open onto the bedroom (not much privacy).

This hotel near to the beachside with only 5 mins walking distance.  Breakfast with delicious taste but limited choice. (Remark: Kids also need to pay 99bath)  Overall we really happy with this hotel stay.

Saeksarn wrote a review Jan 2016,50,Chilling and Good View Hotel,"The theme of our Getaway to Jomtein beach is to avoid the hustle and bustle of the city. D Living is a great choice of hotel if you are looking to enjoy the calm and the peacefulness away from the city. In the center of the hotel there is a swimming pool. During the night time the lights are switch on which create romantic ambiance. The room was big and clean with comfortable bed. Eventho it is far from pattaya but the public pick up truck are available almost anytime and the fee is only THB 20. The beach at Jomtien beach is better then pattaya. Hoewever the hotel does not provide toiletries and the information of tourist attraction at the receptionist is not sufficient.
