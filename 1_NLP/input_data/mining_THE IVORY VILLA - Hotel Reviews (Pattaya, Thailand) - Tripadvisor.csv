brian harnetty wrote a review Nov 2019,50,Wonderful surprise.,"We had not stayed here before my holiday this year, taking a chance . We used to live nearbye on holiday but the owner sold his house. When we arrived We were welcomed and given an upgrade to a delightful room on the seventh floor, which would become our home tor the next month.. It is a busy hotel, but very efficient. The food, we enjoyed, although we only took breakfast . Thailand has so many wonderful places to eat in. The hotel itself is extremely clean, the staff very helpful, The top floor has a swimming pool where we swam everyday and 95 per cent of the time we had to ourselves. The location of the hotel is ideal, quiet,but near enough the town to visit, and to catch connections to Bangkok.. The hotels taxi service is excellent and you dont get ripped off.

Myra B wrote a review Jul 2018,50,They deserve my respect,"Stayed for a night and would definitely come back again next time. The rooms and other facilities are clean. Staff members are friendly even if they seemed not comfortable to speak English, they're still accommodating. The night duty at front desk let me use their phone charger for the whole night! Way different from our stay at Dvaree last week. Their staff should learn from The Ivory's staff on how to treat the customers right. We got the standard room at 1,200 including a decent, organized and clean buffet breakfast and we were treated the same as other high-paying customers.

PPm wrote a review Jan 2018,10,One bad employee ruined the whole stay,"Copy paste from my booking.com review    The good :    This was our second time staying at this hotel. The staff is helpful and polite and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. The breakfast buffet is great and we enjoyed the rooftop pool once again. Location a bit far but good if you need space from all the tourists that come Pattaya. This time we used the free parking and it's very convenient, location felt a lot better with a car.    The bad:    So if we love this hotel why did we rate it so low? At checkout we were tried to be charged for 2 bottles of mineral water from the minibar that we didn't consume. We quickly clarified that we didn't consume anything other than the free bottles of drinking water, and this is where the problem arised. The manager in charge at that time, instead of believing us, chose to call their employees and show us their ""inventory"" that said they gave us the item in dispute. Asked us once again if we were sure we didn't forget. This was insulting. In any case their inventory proved they made a mistake, and probably didn't re-stock the minibar from the previous customer that stayed there. To add more to her incompetence, she ""let"" the cleaning staff take responsibility for it and let her ""pay for it"". In reality there was no money involved as the product was never consumed, just an inventory error. The whole time this manager seemed to expect for us to pay, even if from the beginning we clarified we didn't consume anything. And she made a whole show out of it to try and blame us instead of taking responsibility for their mistake, WASTING our time. As soon as we said we don't use anything she should have completed checkout and let us go. Instead as the main representative of the hotel at the moment she chose to lose 2 customers, and many others than read and agree with this review forever.  To add more insult at the end she never appologized and I guess she didn't even realized the grave problem she caused for us, the hotel, and the staff she is supossed to lead. All of this because she didn't take responsibility for the hotel mistake and try to blame it on customers instead. THIS IS NOT HOW TO TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS.","THE IVORY VILLA - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.957663,100.888779&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.957663,100.888779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.958720,100.886070|12.959459,100.886894|12.957578,100.888878|12.956059,100.889862|12.958417,100.885742&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.955278,100.890602|12.958667,100.884949|12.958895,100.885231|12.957106,100.891983|12.956288,100.889046|12.958258,100.889267|12.955101,100.890587|12.958486,100.888756|12.958459,100.892700&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.958800,100.885796|12.958015,100.888489|12.959042,100.887306|12.953860,100.887932|12.959659,100.887077|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191|12.960558,100.887566|12.959488,100.889458&signature=TyKBu9Ro4j_3JEbBQpu2U6pqa7M="

All in all, decent low budget option around north of Pattaya for one or two night max.","THE IVORY VILLA - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.957663,100.888779&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.957663,100.888779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.958720,100.886070|12.959459,100.886894|12.957578,100.888878|12.956059,100.889862|12.958417,100.885742&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.955278,100.890602|12.958667,100.884949|12.958895,100.885231|12.957106,100.891983|12.956288,100.889046|12.958258,100.889267|12.955101,100.890587|12.958486,100.888756|12.958459,100.892700&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.958800,100.885796|12.958015,100.888489|12.959042,100.887306|12.953860,100.887932|12.959659,100.887077|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191|12.960558,100.887566|12.959488,100.889458&signature=TyKBu9Ro4j_3JEbBQpu2U6pqa7M="

Nigelquent wrote a review Jan 2015,30,Need to sort out their water problem.,"When we found this hotel 2 years ago we thought it was wonderful. BUT after three stays there we probably won't go back. They have a real problem with water and after many complaints they show no attempt to fix it. We have never had a hot shower here. The shower water is always freezing and there is only a trickle in the sink.  The breakfast is very poor really your basic Thai farang fare, They can't even put a heater under the eggs so they are always cold.  Having said that the rooms are good. The bed is very comfortable. A double and single in every room. There is a beautiful rooftop pool and garden and parking on site.  Don't pay the extra for a higher floor/ more expensive room. The rooms are all the same the only difference is a slightly better view from the higher floors.  If they ever sort out their hot water problem we might go back as the location is good for us. Better if u have a car..","THE IVORY VILLA - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.957663,100.888779&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.957663,100.888779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.958720,100.886070|12.959459,100.886894|12.957578,100.888878|12.956059,100.889862|12.958417,100.885742&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.955278,100.890602|12.958667,100.884949|12.958895,100.885231|12.957106,100.891983|12.956288,100.889046|12.958258,100.889267|12.955101,100.890587|12.958486,100.888756|12.958459,100.892700&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.958800,100.885796|12.958015,100.888489|12.959042,100.887306|12.953860,100.887932|12.959659,100.887077|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191|12.960558,100.887566|12.959488,100.889458&signature=TyKBu9Ro4j_3JEbBQpu2U6pqa7M="
Sorin M wrote a review Dec 2014,40,Decent Hotel :),"The room are ok , the hotel is new so the rooms are still in good condition.  The view from the room is beautifull we stayed on the 7-th floor and was probably the best view in the hotel , room 709  The roof top of the hotel is nice ...for some photos.  The swimming pool is small , the places by the swimming pool are not enough for all the customers....so we did not get a free space ...so we did not hang by the pool.  The maid was ok, cleening was made in the right way.  The wi-fi , is bad....really bad, even after we informed the staff that we have a problem , still was no improvements , earlly morning no internet , and later very bad....  The hotel is not on the beach , so you need to walk around 15 min to get to the beach , and the nearest beach it not the best one :), but you can find many places by the beach in Pattaya.  If your travelling in group, you just ask the guys on the reception to bring you a car from the main road to take you whatever you need to go , it will cost you 150 to 300 baht.

Benjamin H wrote a review Sep 2014,50,Stay Here !!,"Such helpful friendly people here - They let me do some printing several times whilst I stayed, behind the reception. Amazing position, just a few minutes walk off Naklua Road. Pick a room with a sea view that looks towards the architecturally ugly monster, known as the 'Centara Grand' Hotel - You can look at it knowing the people staying there are pay some stupid extortionately expensive price, of which just being on the beach is factored into it (All sewage in Pattaya runs straight into the sea untreated, therefore, step into the sea with caution!) The view from the roof is phenomenal, you can see right across to Jomtien tower/ Sunsets are awesome. The pool on the roof is also a very decent size, width and depth. Rooms are really comfy, with a massive 'watering can' style shower.

tag420uk wrote a review May 2014,30,Nice but could do better.,Stayed in april for 9 nights. Plenty of places to eat and drink nearby and a brisk walk and your at the beach in about 5 minutes.    Rooms were large and clean good ac in room and balcony. Had tea making facilities in room with complimentary coffee. mini bar was also available and had cable tv that had thai russian and some english channels with a good movie channel.    Pool on rooftop was nice too.    Negatives. Wifi in my room didnt work and considering the wifi box was right outside my room I could never connect unless I was outside my room and held my phone upto the wifi box.    Mentioned it to reception on a couple of occasions but after the third or fourth time they asked if I wanted to change rooms but by this time I was over it.    Breakfast. Had plenty of choice and was tasty but could of been mote tasty had the food been kepted warm.    When we first checked in I could get a freshly cooked omelette in the morning but when the hotel got full they just kept giving me an excuse that the chef was on holiday so couldnt have an omelette which was a bit disappointing.

TagnutMcGuffin wrote a review Feb 2014,30,Could be much better.,"The hotel is in a reasonable location in North Pattaya, just walk to head of road and it's a main Baht Bus route into town. Alternatively it's only about 20 mins walking to hit the nightlife in the centre. Room was extremely good and clean as it's quite a new hotel. Rooftop pool was great. Breakfast was a disappointment, some items had obviously been put out for several days and were crusting over. Nothing was hot and a request for a couple of hot fried eggs resulted in some 'discussion' about what was wrong with the 16 ice cold fried eggs already out! I don't expect that from staff. I'd probably stay again but not include breakfast, there's enough places within a couple of minutes walk for that. The staff seemed disinterested in general, not rude but gave impression they'd rather continue chatting amongst themselves and guests were a hindrance to that. It was comfortable and clean, and if the service was pepped up it would be an excellent hotel.","THE IVORY VILLA - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.957663,100.888779&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.957663,100.888779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.958720,100.886070|12.959459,100.886894|12.957578,100.888878|12.956059,100.889862|12.958417,100.885742&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.955278,100.890602|12.958667,100.884949|12.958895,100.885231|12.957106,100.891983|12.956288,100.889046|12.958258,100.889267|12.955101,100.890587|12.958486,100.888756|12.958459,100.892700&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.958800,100.885796|12.958015,100.888489|12.959042,100.887306|12.953860,100.887932|12.959659,100.887077|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191|12.960558,100.887566|12.959488,100.889458&signature=TyKBu9Ro4j_3JEbBQpu2U6pqa7M="

It's not close to main road,need to walk for 5 mins from hotel. I'm not recomend you to walk from hotel to main road alone in night time.Mostly I always see foreign tourist walk in group.    Room is big and clean, 2 bed inside (staff told me that they offer extra bed for Chinese tour group) Free wifi,Free parking,Flat Tv. and free drinking water.    This hotel is not close to the beach,need to walk for 800-900 metr from hotel.    However,staff are good service mind. Not many choice for breakfast but taste good.

Phil H wrote a review May 2013,40,Good medium range Hotel,"Firstly location: From the Dusit Thani Circle go up the Naklua Road about 1/3 mile then turn left opposite Ayiala Hotel. Down that road about 250 yards on the left.  We had a De Luxe room which was spacious and contained a fridge, flat screen tv, large walk in shower, Double bed, single bed and balcony. Aircon of course.  The fridge stayed on all the time and so we were able to have ice on hand for late night drinks although it has to be said the ice box was very small, but enough for 3 - 4 ice trays.  The room was bright and modern and well serviced by a very friendly chambermaid, who always had a smile for the guests.  Breakfast was included in the price and had a large selection of food including fruit, cereals and thai food but there was a limited selection for Western tastes, but the chef was happy to prepare me an omlette when i asked. Like most Thai hotels I have stayed at, the cooked food was mostly left to get cold even though at this hotel there were burners under the food storage hoppers but they were not often lit. Cold fried eggs are not to my taste! But overall the breakfast was reasonable value.  My only other concern with this hotel was the WiFi which could not be trusted and kept going on and off at different times during the day. My partner, a local Pattaya lady told me that the WiFi Company concerned did have a reputation for not delivering a 100% reliable service. Mostly this was ok for checking e mail and occasional surfing but for the business traveller who needs 100% reliable WiFi this could be a problem. I did intend at one stage to buy airline tickets online but obviously with the relatively large amount of money involved, i decided against it, due to the risk of the WiFi connection failing at a sensitive part of the transactions.  There is a safe in each room, a good size, big enough for a lap top. I did manage to break my safe combination lock for a short time but the reception were happy to lend me the safe key until my safe was fixed but although i handed back the key to reception, when i got back to England I heard from the Hotel that they could not find the key and wanted me to send it back ! So be warned, get a receipt if the same thing happens to you!  There is a 15 metre swimming pool on the 8th and top floor of the hotel which i would highly recommend, the water was very warm and always spotlessly clean and had a good selection of loungers.  Overall I would certainly recommend this hotel, good value, staff all charming, friendly and happy to help with any problems. The only reason for me not giving the hotel 5 stars is the internet problem.","THE IVORY VILLA - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.957663,100.888779&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.957663,100.888779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.958720,100.886070|12.959459,100.886894|12.957578,100.888878|12.956059,100.889862|12.958417,100.885742&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.955278,100.890602|12.958667,100.884949|12.958895,100.885231|12.957106,100.891983|12.956288,100.889046|12.958258,100.889267|12.955101,100.890587|12.958486,100.888756|12.958459,100.892700&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.958800,100.885796|12.958015,100.888489|12.959042,100.887306|12.953860,100.887932|12.959659,100.887077|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191|12.960558,100.887566|12.959488,100.889458&signature=TyKBu9Ro4j_3JEbBQpu2U6pqa7M="
