Mr. Mike wrote a review Feb 2019,10,"Don’t Book Here, Unless You’re a Party Animal","Shooters Guesthouse is 8 rooms inside the same building with the loudest Go Go Bar on Soi 7. With 40 dancers, hotel rooms above are a minor part of the operation. A reception desk is staffed while the bar is up and running (8 hours per day).    There is no separate entrance (and no means of egress, either) so you must come and go through the bar. From 7:00 PM to 3:00 AM, every night, the entire building pounds with thumping nightclub bass. Of the 8 rooms, only #7 or #8 are remotely bearable (3rd floor, rear) if you don’t stay up or out that late each and every night.    Beyond these negatives (for most), I had two bigger problems with Shooters.    First, after realizing my error (there was no warning on Agoda - or any hotel booking website), I shortened my 5-day stay to 3 nights. The hotel refused to offer any refund (lesson learned: never book any hotel that won’t refund any portion of a pre-paid reservation or accept cancellation a day or two in advance).    Second, there were 12 fire extinguishers - that had been inspected or recharged - sitting in a corridor, and they stayed there for the entire duration. There were no fire extinguishers distributed throughout the building - nor was there any fire sprinkler or alternative fire suppression system. Once inside, behind and above the bar, you are locked in, with windows too small to escape through. In other words, there was visible disregard for life-safety.    There are many better options in Pattaya.","SHOOTERS GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.935967,100.885803&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.935967,100.885803&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.936627,100.886177|12.935137,100.882889|12.937580,100.883362|12.932666,100.884048|12.934132,100.887672|12.935380,100.885674|12.934750,100.883934|12.937229,100.884453|12.936051,100.883698&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.935059,100.882851|12.937224,100.885033|12.936464,100.886726|12.934995,100.882263|12.935244,100.882774|12.934985,100.882736|12.937283,100.884842|12.937125,100.884697|12.939547,100.884132&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.935092,100.882813|12.939276,100.885162|12.937654,100.887779|12.936786,100.887123|12.938490,100.885086|12.933731,100.888527|12.936059,100.885422|12.935520,100.885040|12.935594,100.884171&signature=8sDSbmhMQp9PzaAQLN2SM5kEQ74="

Bed large and comfortable with great remote controlled air con. Bathroom modern and large with excellent walk in style rain shower. Linen changed every other day. Toiletries and bottled water included. In room digital safe and free wi fi also. Easy walking distance of bars, restaurants, shops and laundries. Rooms on second floor are quieter. Out of hours access is by RFID key supplied on room key. Accommodation is guest friendly.  Bar is great fun with the coyote dancers and special events but drinks are a little expensive so take care on bar bill.  A great place to stay and have a drink.

David C wrote a review May 2016,50,Return Customer still Excellent Guesthouse,"This was my second stay in 6 months this time for a full month. Once again the staff and owners (Jon and Eid) were very welcoming and friendly. The rooms again were large, modern and kept spotlessly clean with new linens and towels every other day. Additional toiletries are supplied. The rooms are above a Coyote Bar with sexy lady dancers and open till 3am so there is some noise in the rooms but I rather enjoyed that ! The Coyotes are friendly and fun and are up for a chat and game of pool. The guesthouse is guest friendly and secure. RDIF key access and CCTV cameras on each floor. The rooms have digital safes and strong Wi-Fi and superb air con that keeps the room very cool. The showers are large walk in rain shower type that are wonderful. The guesthouse and bar are very centrally situated in Soi 7 with many bars, restaurants and laundries all within walking distance. The price of the rooms are also great value.","SHOOTERS GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.935967,100.885803&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.935967,100.885803&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.936627,100.886177|12.935137,100.882889|12.937580,100.883362|12.932666,100.884048|12.934132,100.887672|12.935380,100.885674|12.934750,100.883934|12.937229,100.884453|12.936051,100.883698&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.935059,100.882851|12.937224,100.885033|12.936464,100.886726|12.934995,100.882263|12.935244,100.882774|12.934985,100.882736|12.937283,100.884842|12.937125,100.884697|12.939547,100.884132&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.935092,100.882813|12.939276,100.885162|12.937654,100.887779|12.936786,100.887123|12.938490,100.885086|12.933731,100.888527|12.936059,100.885422|12.935520,100.885040|12.935594,100.884171&signature=8sDSbmhMQp9PzaAQLN2SM5kEQ74="

David C wrote a review Nov 2015,50,Fantastic 3 week stay.,"I have just returned after 3 great weeks at Shooters and have already booked a return visit. I will split this review into 2 parts i.e rooms/bars.    Room  *******  The rooms are big, modern and have very little clutter in them. There is a digital safe and free wi fi which is quite strong. The bathroom is modern and a superb large walk in shower.The lady cleaner keeps the rooms spotless and you get 2 bottles of complimentary water each day and fresh linen every other day. Especially notable is the air con is excellent. You can get the room very cold so much that I had to turn it off a couple of times!!Yes in your room you can hear music from the bar downstairs (it stops at 3am) but what do you expect at a bar/guesthouse. It's not that loud to be honest.    Bar  ****  Don't make the same mistake as me in that this is a coyote bar not a typical Pattaya Beer Bar where to the bar ladies are pushy and will approach you. I just sat quietly the first couple of times and the girls will not hassle you. You need to make an effort to speak to a coyote or buy on a drink you like dancing. Once you have broken the ice the girls are lovely. Will spend time with you, flirt and play and always willing to give you a game of pool on their quality pool table (if you like a challenge try Coyote Number 9 she is the number 1 player there and great fun).  The bar is fun and entertaining always and the girls are top quality and well paid. The bar fine is high (1000THB) but the girls are top notch.    Summary  ***********  Highly recommended for room or just a visit to the bar. You wont regret it.","SHOOTERS GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.935967,100.885803&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.935967,100.885803&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.936627,100.886177|12.935137,100.882889|12.937580,100.883362|12.932666,100.884048|12.934132,100.887672|12.935380,100.885674|12.934750,100.883934|12.937229,100.884453|12.936051,100.883698&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.935059,100.882851|12.937224,100.885033|12.936464,100.886726|12.934995,100.882263|12.935244,100.882774|12.934985,100.882736|12.937283,100.884842|12.937125,100.884697|12.939547,100.884132&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.935092,100.882813|12.939276,100.885162|12.937654,100.887779|12.936786,100.887123|12.938490,100.885086|12.933731,100.888527|12.936059,100.885422|12.935520,100.885040|12.935594,100.884171&signature=8sDSbmhMQp9PzaAQLN2SM5kEQ74="

Hardlypodd wrote a review Apr 2015,50,Well this place is interesting! :-),"Great location off the Beach Road in the North of Pattaya, easy to get anywhere on the blue baht buses/pickups. The bar during the day is deserted, but at 8pm it comes alive...and alive it stays...until about 4am, like the rest of Pattaya...I was on the 2nd floor, and you could still hear the music but it wasn't too obtrusive and by that time I was ready for some deep sleep anyway. There's a 1000 baht deposit on arrival, and there was no ""fun and games"" trying to get it back on check-out. All very above-board. All the staff are very very friendly and accommodating. There's no lift incidentally. The shower wasn't too keen on dispensing hot water at any point during my stay. Tepid was the best I managed, but it's so hot outside, you're not really after hot showers. The aircon would freeze a penguin if you turn it on. WiFi was excellent, I even downloaded several films (legally of course ;-) while I was there, no problem. There's a stocked fridge (without a tariff, but the shooters branded water is free) and some other items available you don't normally find in a hotel...as well as plenty of takeaway options...This is a hotel for single guys, I'll leave it at that. 800 Baht bar fine (allegedly). There's a 7-11 right outside and there's PLENTY of life in the area. I'd visit again, although I did find out some people staying there got a better ""Walk in rate"" than I did with Agoda.","SHOOTERS GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.935967,100.885803&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.935967,100.885803&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.936627,100.886177|12.935137,100.882889|12.937580,100.883362|12.932666,100.884048|12.934132,100.887672|12.935380,100.885674|12.934750,100.883934|12.937229,100.884453|12.936051,100.883698&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.935059,100.882851|12.937224,100.885033|12.936464,100.886726|12.934995,100.882263|12.935244,100.882774|12.934985,100.882736|12.937283,100.884842|12.937125,100.884697|12.939547,100.884132&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.935092,100.882813|12.939276,100.885162|12.937654,100.887779|12.936786,100.887123|12.938490,100.885086|12.933731,100.888527|12.936059,100.885422|12.935520,100.885040|12.935594,100.884171&signature=8sDSbmhMQp9PzaAQLN2SM5kEQ74="

There are eateries (some Western), a 7-11, motorbike rental, airport taxi service, and a Laundry Cleaners nearby.    It's a friendly 10 minute walk to the beach (well lit at night with bars along the way)    The price was affordable (comparatively speaking).    Unfortunately, I have to choose ""loud"" on the questionnaire. Obviously, with a ""night club/bar"" on the ground floor, the sound of the bass speakers is going to resonate throughout the building (until about 1AM). But, I was used to it by the second night and it didn't bother me the rest of my stay.

I was very happy with my stay at Shooters and will be back.","SHOOTERS GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.935967,100.885803&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.935967,100.885803&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.936627,100.886177|12.935137,100.882889|12.937580,100.883362|12.932666,100.884048|12.934132,100.887672|12.935380,100.885674|12.934750,100.883934|12.937229,100.884453|12.936051,100.883698&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.935059,100.882851|12.937224,100.885033|12.936464,100.886726|12.934995,100.882263|12.935244,100.882774|12.934985,100.882736|12.937283,100.884842|12.937125,100.884697|12.939547,100.884132&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.935092,100.882813|12.939276,100.885162|12.937654,100.887779|12.936786,100.887123|12.938490,100.885086|12.933731,100.888527|12.936059,100.885422|12.935520,100.885040|12.935594,100.884171&signature=8sDSbmhMQp9PzaAQLN2SM5kEQ74="
losoloso wrote a review Jun 2014,40,A gem,"I strayed from my normal accommodation as shooters is new and new usually means new beds.I'd say the best Sleep I've had in a long time.The rooms are very spacious and a big rain shower which was really lovely.Vert spacious shower,can easily fit 3 in.The bar downstairs has a really great sound system and a pro pool table.The staff I have to say are some of nicest I have ever had the privilege of meeting.The coyote girls are the best looking I have seen around Town.What more can I say,the only one negative is the drapes are abit on the thin side.Could do with a Sun screen as the morning Sun can be blazing.Enough said ,fine fine establishment.","SHOOTERS GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.935967,100.885803&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.935967,100.885803&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.936627,100.886177|12.935137,100.882889|12.937580,100.883362|12.932666,100.884048|12.934132,100.887672|12.935380,100.885674|12.934750,100.883934|12.937229,100.884453|12.936051,100.883698&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.935059,100.882851|12.937224,100.885033|12.936464,100.886726|12.934995,100.882263|12.935244,100.882774|12.934985,100.882736|12.937283,100.884842|12.937125,100.884697|12.939547,100.884132&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.935092,100.882813|12.939276,100.885162|12.937654,100.887779|12.936786,100.887123|12.938490,100.885086|12.933731,100.888527|12.936059,100.885422|12.935520,100.885040|12.935594,100.884171&signature=8sDSbmhMQp9PzaAQLN2SM5kEQ74="
