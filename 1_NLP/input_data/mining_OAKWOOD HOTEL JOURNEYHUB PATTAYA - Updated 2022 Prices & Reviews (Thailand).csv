Location is what it is on second Road so no decent views.  Extremely comfy bed and all the room facilities worked to the highest order.  A couple of niggles: the loo is far too close to the shower screen making it very difficult to use, there is no balcony furniture which is very poor and there isn't a clothes drying rack.

Stephanie R wrote a review Jul 2020,50,We will be back!,"We needed an affordable place to stay for the weekend that was near the pier since we were going to be finishing our PADI certification. After searching, and finding several places were still closed, we found the website for Oakwood Hotel. We booked online.    First, this isn't a hotel with a beach view. If that is what you're looking for, you will be disappointed. However, if you are looking for a quiet, friendly, clean, and comfortable place to stay, away from the noise of the walking street, but close enough to it for a visit, this is where you should stay. There are several Thai restaurants in short walking distance, a shopping area that connects to one of the main streets, etc. for the evenings.    Every staff member was extremely kind and helpful as we checked in on Friday, went in and out on Saturday, and checked out on Sunday. They kept our luggage secure after check out so we could finish our final dives before returning to Bangkok Sunday night. The breakfast was outstanding with many choices (Thai and western), fresh vegetables, and eggs made to order. We did enough time in the water with Scuba gear, so we did not try the pool, but it was quite nice-looking. While we were there, the hotel is donating a large bag of rice for each guest to help those adversely affected by the pandemic. What a great idea!

PrassannaKumar wrote a review Dec 2019,50,The Best in Pattaya!,"We were a group of 3 travellers from India and after a lot of research ended up booking at Oakwood Hotel, Pattaya. After checking-in, we realized that this was a great choice of stay at Pattaya. Hotel situated right behind Pattaya Avenue mall is the biggest advantage as it's walk-able to the beach and to the Walking Street. The rooms are cozy, clean and the housekeeping service is on their toes to make sure your stay is spent well without any hassles. The best part is that Arijit (GM - Oakwood) frequents the hotel and personally checks for the guest's experience and his suggestions on Clubs, Restaurants and other places never let us down.

Pravin H wrote a review Dec 2019,50,7 star service!!!,I visited the hotel in Dec with couple of my friends. What struck a chord with us immediately was the warm welcome we were given by Usa & team. We were upgraded to the suite rooms. We requested couple of things in the room & the front desk worked immediately to have those fixed in 5 mins!!! The rooms look 5 star & well appointed.    Our trip was made complete by the warm hospitality extended to us by the GM of the property Mr Arijit Ghosh. He went out of his way to ensure we feel welcomed. All the suggestions he gave us on food & places to explore were right on the money. We bumped into him outside as well & he was kind enough to get us VIP treatment in one of the clubs. Never have I experienced this personal touch considering I travel a lot for work & stay in best properties around the world.    The restaurant upstairs serves good food & restaurant manager was very friendly to us. He prepared the dishes fresh for us & it was great breakfast.    Last but not the least the staff at this hotel were always kind to my friends & I. We never got NO for an answer & they ensured they gave us 7 star service in the midst of all the chaos of big tour groups they had to support as well!!!

HotindTraveller wrote a review Jul 2019,50,Great hotel in Pattaya to stay with!,"Stayed there in second week of June with friends in the base category room (deluxe) for three days. It's a new hotel, and the rooms are nicely done. The cleanliness, not only in the rooms but also in all the areas are commendable. The beds are so comfortable that you will start feeling sleepy once you lay down on them.The hotel is just at the centre of the city but still undisturbed from the traffic and busyness of the city. Have a nice swimming pool at the roof top, and the restaurant is next to it. The restaurant serves international food with local flavours, and some Indian varieties too. The food quality is good and with good taste. The entire staffs are amazing, and are ready to assist anytime. The beach is about 150 meters if walked through the Avenue Mall in front of the hotel. Quite near to Central Festival shopping mall and Pattaya Night Bazar.  We enjoyed staying at this hotel and would definitely try it again. Will surely recommend to friends and family.
