David L wrote a review Mar 2018,20,Typical business run on a shoestring,"Looks really nice on arrival - very handily located for the Pattaya Big Buddha.  Reception - guy behind the counter appeared to not know that he worked in a hotel - comical conversation where he didn't know anything about the check-in process or how to check we had a booking.  Eventually, after a chat with another staff member we ended up with the room we had booked. Be aware, there are NO LIFTS so if you have heavy cases, be prepared to get sweaty!  Very hard bed with a mattress that had seen better days - the springs creaked every time you moved. This is a shame as the room was spotless and the cleaner (she was just finishing as we arrived) had taken the time to spray the room for bugs and had obviosly cleaned the room to a high standard.  Another hotel that has a tired feeling where too little investment has been made in either facilities or staff well being - very disgruntled staff that appear frightened to do the right thing i.e. look after the customer!  Very noisy air conditioning that vibrated through the room all night.  One of those ""run around until you get wet"" showers. Toilet that continually overflowed so running water noise all night.  Breakfast was a complete joke - obviously the staff have been told only to give out a certain amount of things (each plate of items is carefully counted out before serving) but basically it amounted to 6 pieces of potatoes, 8-9 baked beans and 2 (maybe 3) small pieces of bacon (if you choose that option) and a very small portion of scrambled egg or a an omelette. If you eat outside the dining room (which seems like a pleasant idea if it's a nice day - make sure you have bug spray or you will get eaten alive).  No rice available for those who are Asian (it's a staple diet item for Thais - er, and we are in Thailand).  No chance of getting anything more other than perhaps a couple of bits of toast (with absolutely awful jam if you want it) - I even felt guilty having a second cup of coffee!  Such a shame, this place has lots of potential but the owners seem determined to wring every last bit of yield out of it before doing anything about replacing things or fixing things properly - the room I was in had a particularly dangerous electrical socket for the bedside lamp that had ""electrocution"" written all over it!  For the owners: Cushions in the reception area seating were disgusting - please change them!  Spend some cash repairing things and getting things looking better - rusty air con units and broken palisade posts around the pool and other areas just shows you don't care and are determined to milk it for everything you can. It's a lovely place with a great location and you are in danger of messing it up. Stop building new things and instead invest in what you have.",HILLSIDE RESORT PATTAYA - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.917124,100.865776&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.917124,100.865776&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.920770,100.866524|12.919580,100.867058|12.916930,100.866753|12.917850,100.867500|12.915430,100.865410|12.917980,100.868912&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.918758,100.869606|12.913967,100.867020|12.915426,100.866028|12.921231,100.866676|12.915284,100.862770|12.915576,100.866371|12.915956,100.862373|12.916930,100.866753|12.914410,100.866608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.913719,100.867088|12.915452,100.862419|12.915844,100.866249|12.916349,100.870102|12.914198,100.867195|12.919668,100.862770|12.916614,100.862007|12.915245,100.862549|12.919222,100.862717&signature=uf8HwOc2eM5lN1ZVPkoWX5yZA2Q="

Lisa Marie V wrote a review Oct 2017,40,Extremely satisfied!,"I had a great stay at Hillside. Was visiting Thailand with a bunch of friends and this resort deemed very sensibly priced. The hotel was moderately big and the rooms were spacious and tidy. I was very anxious about cleanliness but the hygiene standard surpassed my expectations.  I had a great vacation it was super fun. The staff didn't speak much English, however, they were very helpful and gave good advice on things to do nearby such as visiting the Pattaya and Jomtiem Beach and the popular Walking Street which is by the way so close by! There is also a temple completely carved of wood called Sanctuary of Truth, would not have known about this if it wasn't for the lady at the front desk.    Pattaya had lots of nightout options making it a great and happening place to visit for friends. I'd also like to add that being a woman I really appreciate the security and safeness of the hotel.

The good thing is its very quiet in the night. the Staffs are quite Okay...You need to tell them what you wanted and they will provide it for you.  you will need to rent a Motorbike from the hotel, or in front of the hotel at the cost around $3-5 per day (I am not sure) to go the the city or the beach because it's on the Hill.

tammyBaltimore_Md wrote a review Apr 2014,30,"Hotel top of Pattaya, rooms very modest","Hotel is far from the city centre on top of the hill, walking distance from the Big Buddha, and to local shops (7-11). Check in staff were very friendly and nice, room was very modest, not much to write home about but ok for the night. The room I was placed into had no remotes for tv or a/c, asked if I wanted to be changed down the hall,room not as cold, but remotes. Asked manager to look for remotes while I was gone to city exploring; returned hours later to new female clerk, who tried to tell me I couldn't move, but also didn't understand english all that well, luckily the day clerk came back and had no problem with me switching rooms at that time (730pm).  Computer in front lobby charged 20baht per hour (not bad,less than 1 dollar), breakfast was in beautiful courtyard below, also very minimal but pleasant.  Since hotel is basically in the middle of nowhere so to speak,I would have (if had to do it over), I would have picked a hotel in city centre, where you can walk right outside to the husdtle bustle of any big city life, BUT that's you're preference of course. Remote in country setting or city,I say what I say because when I travel to a place I've never been to I would like to know where actually I'm staying and what's around me to do and see. Your call!

wennitiong wrote a review Mar 2013,20,"Secluded location, old but quiet","This lodge is not nearby to any attraction in Pattaya, but if you're very familiar with the tuk tuk and the Pattaya area, access to other areas still easy by the uses of tuk-tuk (which price can be as low as 10 baht per head). The room is very old, and only basic amenities available. If you're on budget to travel, and prefer a place to avoid noise from busy street at Pattaya, this can be a choice.

bladeriderWales-UK wrote a review Jul 2012,10,"Hillside Resort, Pattaya - under new management","Having already given a good review of this hotel, I feel that under their new management, a new review is called for.  I returned from my third stay at the Hillside Resort in January, 2012 but although on my most recent visit to Pattaya in July, 2012 I stayed at a different hotel. I decided to go up to visit my two friends who reside permanently at the Hillside Resort.  I parked my motorbike in the parking area and approached the reception area to visit my friends. However, the new Indian manager of the hotel told me in no uncertain terms that I wasn't allowed to park in the parking area because I wasn,t a guest. I explained that I had stayed at Hillside Resort many times and was merely visiting my friends, who were expecting me.  He was very abrupt and uncompromising and told me that visitors were not welcome to use the parking area - even though it was almost empty, as was the hotel!  My plans to possibly stay there again on my next visit have been scuppered because there is no way I will ever stay there again.

However, the beach is not really clean early morning. Hotel is clean, Excellent clean n Small swimming pool, Excellent room. Strong wifi. Very spacious. Was not expecting that much space for the price. Not crowded. Owner and front desk person were extremely nice and accommodating. Bathroom was nice. Hot water, plenty of space in shower. This hotel was recently remodeled/updated. Only negative i can see for some people is that it is pretty far from the craziness of Walking Street. But I was looking for quiet plaqce... So it was perfect.if one I wants to hit up the town, it's only approx 250 bht for a scooter. for 24 hours (which is pretty good value for money). Hotel Feature Tip: This is a good place for your holiday, relax and far from Hustle and bustle. Accommodation cost is quite reasonable..... VIVA....RE VIVA... GOOD LUCK.

I usually hire a motorbike as it iis a fair walk from Pattaya and Jomtien.

Chang N wrote a review Oct 2011,40,decent hotel for fair price,"I stayed in this hotel 3 times. It's located on soi 2, Pratamnak hill. Pros : not far from the cleanest Asia Pattaya beach, nice garden and cafe attached, with free pool table. Also, it has a tiny swimming pool, but also the bigger one is available just across the road, at the Pattaya Hill resort. I paid as few as 550 baht for twin bed room, and it even had a bathtub and a balcony ! Another plus is - very quiet at any time of a day, however not far from main attractions, equidistant to Jomtien and Pattaya. Laundry is available as well. This hotel is girlfriendly, only the girl's ID is required on the reception desk, they hold it untiil she leaves.  Cons : Although it's not far from both Jomtien and Walking street, you will need either rent a motobike or use motorbike taxi, parked near FamilyMart shop. I used to pay 60 baht for a ride to soi 6, which is quite fair price.

patience2010 wrote a review Jan 2011,40,Great location but,"This hotel is located on top of the hills overlooking Pattaya. To get a sense of its location, Google Sheraton Pattaya Hill Resort. Its located about 5 minutes from there. You are in a prime location without paying the prime prices. It is also 15 minute walking distance to main Pattaya Beach and there are lots of buses that pass by. Here is my take:    Pluses:  1. Affordable rates if you book online  2. Clean swimming pool and clean sheets  3. You can actually sleep at night with the windows open. Unlike beach area pattaya, the hills are quite. This is important because Thailand is a loud place and discos sometimes go all night.    Negatives:  1. Expensive internet-go into town to check your email.  2. One of the clerks is too clever. Tried to charge me extra 400baht for my last night. Fortunately, when checking out, an honest clerk charged me the correct rate.  3. If you are night partier, you will need to take transportation from the beach area. Don't pay more than 100 Baht (regular price is 20-30 baht) but at night, farang prices are in play.",HILLSIDE RESORT PATTAYA - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.917124,100.865776&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.917124,100.865776&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.920770,100.866524|12.919580,100.867058|12.916930,100.866753|12.917850,100.867500|12.915430,100.865410|12.917980,100.868912&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.918758,100.869606|12.913967,100.867020|12.915426,100.866028|12.921231,100.866676|12.915284,100.862770|12.915576,100.866371|12.915956,100.862373|12.916930,100.866753|12.914410,100.866608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.913719,100.867088|12.915452,100.862419|12.915844,100.866249|12.916349,100.870102|12.914198,100.867195|12.919668,100.862770|12.916614,100.862007|12.915245,100.862549|12.919222,100.862717&signature=uf8HwOc2eM5lN1ZVPkoWX5yZA2Q="
