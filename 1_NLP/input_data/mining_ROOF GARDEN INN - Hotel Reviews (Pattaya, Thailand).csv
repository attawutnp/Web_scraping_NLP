CottonZ wrote a review Jan 2014,30,Bit of a hot walk uphill from town,"You'll need to factor in the costs of bahtbuses, taxis or scooter-taxis (great fun that they are!) because the walk back from town is no fun in Pattaya's humidity, even in January. Not a bad hotel, no complaints with the room (wifi bit sporadic though), but owner tried to double-charge me - for which the web agency (Agoda) have since given a 15% refund.

Aidan F wrote a review Dec 2013,40,Enjoyed our stay,"Only stayed for 2 nights in December but would recommend to anyone on a budget. If you're after a hotel that's relatively close to walking street then you've hit the jackpot. Can either get a cheap taxi ride to walking street or you can walk it as well - takes about 10-15 minutes to walk. Hotel itself had really good wifi connection which was included, tea & coffee and a fridge. Stayed in about 4 hotels around Thailand and would say this was the best out of the lot - you get what you pay for and more. Only issue we had was the guy on reception seemed more concerned about scamming us out of more money than actually checking us in . He advised us that there was a mix-up with our booking so we ended up having to pay a few more hunded baht! Other than the mix-up whilst checking in we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.","ROOF GARDEN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.910090,100.868752&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.910090,100.868752&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.905955,100.869308|12.910090,100.868752|12.912820,100.867783&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.906431,100.869209|12.906008,100.869255|12.913666,100.870483|12.906116,100.869186|12.906928,100.869156|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913518,100.870934&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.911690,100.871002|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.909583,100.865700|12.912065,100.868279|12.911870,100.870506|12.910868,100.872353|12.911315,100.864922|12.909760,100.871567&signature=3kVEH7fgCimuPXoHTkjOo2jWcSs="

You have to check out everyday and check in in order to get two water bottles free.    So, once this was my favorite place in Pattaya, now i would not go back.    There is no friendliness in this hotel, unless you flash money. The hotel is falling apart compared to before. The showers was dirty, so was the room.

The bathroom is excellent for a room at this price, large area, nice big shower big enough for 2 people with strong water flow. Good flat-screen TV, huge king size bed and plenty of wardrobe space for your clothes. Very nice in all.    No lift so if climbing stairs is a problem this is not for you. (I had to carry my drunk girlfriend up 3 floors one night which was not so fun).    Location is halfway between Jomtien and Pattaya on a regular baht bus route (10 baht to anywhere) so it is fine for the beach in the daytime and Pattaya nightlife too.    No joiner fees for those that bring friends back for the night.    No breakfast at the hotel but many available nearby and supermarket opposite....so no problems    Note there is building construction behind the hotel at the moment, was quiet when I was on there as site was on holiday, could be a nuisance in the afternoons if you like to sleep then.

ColinX100 wrote a review Apr 2012,40,Great Value Small Hotel,"Having read favourable reviews of RGI I decided to book and stay for 3 nights recently, in April. We stayed in the deluxe with balcony which was quite satisfactory, clean, comfortable king bed, and great bathroom with shower and good water pressure (something that can be a bit hit and miss in Pattaya-Jomtien). The staff were quite friendly, and the rate at 700 baht per night (no breakfast) was very good. The location halfway between Pattaya and Jomtien, on the baht bus route (10 baht per trip) is quite good as you can do the better Jomtien beach in the daytime, then all the shopping and Pattaya nightlife in the evening. There is construction of an apartment block behind the hotel so there is a bit of building noise during the day, nights are fine.","ROOF GARDEN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.910090,100.868752&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.910090,100.868752&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.905955,100.869308|12.910090,100.868752|12.912820,100.867783&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.906431,100.869209|12.906008,100.869255|12.913666,100.870483|12.906116,100.869186|12.906928,100.869156|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913518,100.870934&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.911690,100.871002|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.909583,100.865700|12.912065,100.868279|12.911870,100.870506|12.910868,100.872353|12.911315,100.864922|12.909760,100.871567&signature=3kVEH7fgCimuPXoHTkjOo2jWcSs="

travelingwilbury2008 wrote a review Jul 2011,40,Excellent Budget Hotel in Pattaya,"I have stayed here several times over the past 5 or 6 years and have always had the same level of experience staying here. The staff is very , very nice and the other hotel patrons have always been friendly , being a smaller place than , say , a high-rise where there are hundreds of people coming and going. It is clean and you just cannot do better for the price. Everything is in good working order , a well-designed bathroom and overall pretty drag comfortable. There are , I think , 4 floors and there is no lift, but it is certainly not a deal-breaker for me. There are dining options in the neighborhood. The hotel offers high speed internet for free, as well. I believe toast and coffee is available to guests free , although I did not partake. Lastly, I actually like the location as it is approximately equi-distant between Pattaya and Jomtien and it is a quiet neighborhood at night. Alot of us appreciate that because , if you get in the wrong place in Patts, you are subject to quite an onslaught of party noise. Not for me , thanks. I highly recommend Roof Garden Inn as it is an excellent value for your money spent. I hope they are always around for me to return to on future trips to the area. I give it a 5 star rating because of what you receive in return for the extremely reasonable rate, but it is not a 5 star hotel , per se. No in the same sense that the Dusit Thani or the Hilton or any of the high end places are. But , you'd be paying at least 10 times the amount per night.","ROOF GARDEN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.910090,100.868752&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.910090,100.868752&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.905955,100.869308|12.910090,100.868752|12.912820,100.867783&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.906431,100.869209|12.906008,100.869255|12.913666,100.870483|12.906116,100.869186|12.906928,100.869156|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913518,100.870934&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.911690,100.871002|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.909583,100.865700|12.912065,100.868279|12.911870,100.870506|12.910868,100.872353|12.911315,100.864922|12.909760,100.871567&signature=3kVEH7fgCimuPXoHTkjOo2jWcSs="
cracker99 wrote a review Feb 2010,40,I keep going back,"I have stayed here several time since January 2009, and while the road works between Pattaya and Jomtien can get a bit dusty, its a great location for quick travel in either direction via the cheap baht buses.    Its well run, clean, secure, inexpensive, good location and friendly staff.    On the down side they dont have a lift so if you have a lot of luggage or mobility problems ask for the first floor. Some of the rooms do realy smell of smoking, it would be better if they had some No-smoking rooms. They have two classes of room but the only real differnace in that the Delux are at the front with a balconey and the Superior have this slightly weird goldfish bowl set up with the window opening out onto the corridor (you spend a lot of time with the curtains closed). While there are tea/coffee making facilties in the room, there is no tea/coffee/sugar/milk provided so unless you go out to 7/11 and buy your own they just dont get used.    I still think this is a great little place for the price and choose to stay there when in pattaya...if you want 4 * go to the Mariat and pay accordingly....for anything from 500-800 baht this is great.","ROOF GARDEN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.910090,100.868752&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.910090,100.868752&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.905955,100.869308|12.910090,100.868752|12.912820,100.867783&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.906431,100.869209|12.906008,100.869255|12.913666,100.870483|12.906116,100.869186|12.906928,100.869156|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913518,100.870934&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.911690,100.871002|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.909583,100.865700|12.912065,100.868279|12.911870,100.870506|12.910868,100.872353|12.911315,100.864922|12.909760,100.871567&signature=3kVEH7fgCimuPXoHTkjOo2jWcSs="

Wheredidthepizzago wrote a review May 2009,40,Good place,"I been here a few times and i think its good that the skipped the thaigirl theme at this hotel. You check in for the hotel, not girls. The location is not the best, but its very easy to get anywhere from the bath-pickups outside so it does matter much to me. The rooms are fitted with extra good windows so noice stays outside. No breakfast is served but 20 meter to the right they have ok breakfast. I strongly feel that if they cut the price a bit it would attract more people, especially low season. Low-season you can get a great deal om most hotels in Pattaya, just dont be shy and dont tell the others at the hotel.    Now people hesitate since its in the middle from Pattaya and Jomtien. They do have Internet, but they should really upgrade the equipment to wireless. Its cheap nowadays and the box they provide is not state of the art.  7eleven is about 150 meters away across busy road.","ROOF GARDEN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.910090,100.868752&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.910090,100.868752&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.905955,100.869308|12.910090,100.868752|12.912820,100.867783&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.906431,100.869209|12.906008,100.869255|12.913666,100.870483|12.906116,100.869186|12.906928,100.869156|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913518,100.870934&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.911690,100.871002|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.909583,100.865700|12.912065,100.868279|12.911870,100.870506|12.910868,100.872353|12.911315,100.864922|12.909760,100.871567&signature=3kVEH7fgCimuPXoHTkjOo2jWcSs="

Not a bad hotel, no complaints with the room (wifi bit sporadic though), but owner tried to double-charge me - for which the web agency (Agoda) have since given a 15% refund.

Aidan F wrote a review Dec 2013,40,Enjoyed our stay,"Only stayed for 2 nights in December but would recommend to anyone on a budget. If you're after a hotel that's relatively close to walking street then you've hit the jackpot. Can either get a cheap taxi ride to walking street or you can walk it as well - takes about 10-15 minutes to walk. Hotel itself had really good wifi connection which was included, tea & coffee and a fridge. Stayed in about 4 hotels around Thailand and would say this was the best out of the lot - you get what you pay for and more. Only issue we had was the guy on reception seemed more concerned about scamming us out of more money than actually checking us in . He advised us that there was a mix-up with our booking so we ended up having to pay a few more hunded baht! Other than the mix-up whilst checking in we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.","ROOF GARDEN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.910090,100.868752&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.910090,100.868752&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.905955,100.869308|12.910090,100.868752|12.912820,100.867783&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.906431,100.869209|12.906008,100.869255|12.913666,100.870483|12.906116,100.869186|12.906928,100.869156|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913518,100.870934&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.911690,100.871002|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.909583,100.865700|12.912065,100.868279|12.911870,100.870506|12.910868,100.872353|12.911315,100.864922|12.909760,100.871567&signature=3kVEH7fgCimuPXoHTkjOo2jWcSs="

The bathroom is excellent for a room at this price, large area, nice big shower big enough for 2 people with strong water flow. Good flat-screen TV, huge king size bed and plenty of wardrobe space for your clothes. Very nice in all.    No lift so if climbing stairs is a problem this is not for you. (I had to carry my drunk girlfriend up 3 floors one night which was not so fun).    Location is halfway between Jomtien and Pattaya on a regular baht bus route (10 baht to anywhere) so it is fine for the beach in the daytime and Pattaya nightlife too.    No joiner fees for those that bring friends back for the night.    No breakfast at the hotel but many available nearby and supermarket opposite....so no problems    Note there is building construction behind the hotel at the moment, was quiet when I was on there as site was on holiday, could be a nuisance in the afternoons if you like to sleep then.

The staff were quite friendly, and the rate at 700 baht per night (no breakfast) was very good. The location halfway between Pattaya and Jomtien, on the baht bus route (10 baht per trip) is quite good as you can do the better Jomtien beach in the daytime, then all the shopping and Pattaya nightlife in the evening.

travelingwilbury2008 wrote a review Jul 2011,40,Excellent Budget Hotel in Pattaya,"I have stayed here several times over the past 5 or 6 years and have always had the same level of experience staying here. The staff is very , very nice and the other hotel patrons have always been friendly , being a smaller place than , say , a high-rise where there are hundreds of people coming and going. It is clean and you just cannot do better for the price. Everything is in good working order , a well-designed bathroom and overall pretty drag comfortable. There are , I think , 4 floors and there is no lift, but it is certainly not a deal-breaker for me. There are dining options in the neighborhood. The hotel offers high speed internet for free, as well. I believe toast and coffee is available to guests free , although I did not partake. Lastly, I actually like the location as it is approximately equi-distant between Pattaya and Jomtien and it is a quiet neighborhood at night. Alot of us appreciate that because , if you get in the wrong place in Patts, you are subject to quite an onslaught of party noise. Not for me , thanks. I highly recommend Roof Garden Inn as it is an excellent value for your money spent. I hope they are always around for me to return to on future trips to the area. I give it a 5 star rating because of what you receive in return for the extremely reasonable rate, but it is not a 5 star hotel , per se. No in the same sense that the Dusit Thani or the Hilton or any of the high end places are. But , you'd be paying at least 10 times the amount per night.","ROOF GARDEN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.910090,100.868752&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.910090,100.868752&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.905955,100.869308|12.910090,100.868752|12.912820,100.867783&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.906431,100.869209|12.906008,100.869255|12.913666,100.870483|12.906116,100.869186|12.906928,100.869156|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913518,100.870934&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.911690,100.871002|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.909583,100.865700|12.912065,100.868279|12.911870,100.870506|12.910868,100.872353|12.911315,100.864922|12.909760,100.871567&signature=3kVEH7fgCimuPXoHTkjOo2jWcSs="
cracker99 wrote a review Feb 2010,40,I keep going back,"I have stayed here several time since January 2009, and while the road works between Pattaya and Jomtien can get a bit dusty, its a great location for quick travel in either direction via the cheap baht buses.    Its well run, clean, secure, inexpensive, good location and friendly staff.    On the down side they dont have a lift so if you have a lot of luggage or mobility problems ask for the first floor. Some of the rooms do realy smell of smoking, it would be better if they had some No-smoking rooms. They have two classes of room but the only real differnace in that the Delux are at the front with a balconey and the Superior have this slightly weird goldfish bowl set up with the window opening out onto the corridor (you spend a lot of time with the curtains closed). While there are tea/coffee making facilties in the room, there is no tea/coffee/sugar/milk provided so unless you go out to 7/11 and buy your own they just dont get used.    I still think this is a great little place for the price and choose to stay there when in pattaya...if you want 4 * go to the Mariat and pay accordingly....for anything from 500-800 baht this is great.","ROOF GARDEN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.910090,100.868752&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.910090,100.868752&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.905955,100.869308|12.910090,100.868752|12.912820,100.867783&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.906431,100.869209|12.906008,100.869255|12.913666,100.870483|12.906116,100.869186|12.906928,100.869156|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913518,100.870934&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.911690,100.871002|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.909583,100.865700|12.912065,100.868279|12.911870,100.870506|12.910868,100.872353|12.911315,100.864922|12.909760,100.871567&signature=3kVEH7fgCimuPXoHTkjOo2jWcSs="

mrpon wrote a review Sep 2009,10,Not for me!,"Date of Stay: March, 2009  My room window looked into the corridor that was the access to all the rooms .It was like living in an aquarium,everyone peering in unless you kept the curtains closed! The rooms are nice and clean. No food is served. The location is neither in Pattaya nor Jomtien, meaning Baht buses or taxi's to everywhere. It's more a guest house than a hotel,on the constantly busy main road to Jomtein beach and the roof garden is behind a locked gate with no access for guests. Stayed 3 days ,could not be bothered with having to get transport everywhere,it's in no mans land!Stay again ? Never.","ROOF GARDEN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.910090,100.868752&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.910090,100.868752&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.905955,100.869308|12.910090,100.868752|12.912820,100.867783&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.906431,100.869209|12.906008,100.869255|12.913666,100.870483|12.906116,100.869186|12.906928,100.869156|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913518,100.870934&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.911690,100.871002|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.909583,100.865700|12.912065,100.868279|12.911870,100.870506|12.910868,100.872353|12.911315,100.864922|12.909760,100.871567&signature=3kVEH7fgCimuPXoHTkjOo2jWcSs="
Wheredidthepizzago wrote a review May 2009,40,Good place,"I been here a few times and i think its good that the skipped the thaigirl theme at this hotel. You check in for the hotel, not girls. The location is not the best, but its very easy to get anywhere from the bath-pickups outside so it does matter much to me. The rooms are fitted with extra good windows so noice stays outside. No breakfast is served but 20 meter to the right they have ok breakfast. I strongly feel that if they cut the price a bit it would attract more people, especially low season. Low-season you can get a great deal om most hotels in Pattaya, just dont be shy and dont tell the others at the hotel.    Now people hesitate since its in the middle from Pattaya and Jomtien. They do have Internet, but they should really upgrade the equipment to wireless. Its cheap nowadays and the box they provide is not state of the art.  7eleven is about 150 meters away across busy road.","ROOF GARDEN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.910090,100.868752&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.910090,100.868752&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.905955,100.869308|12.910090,100.868752|12.912820,100.867783&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.906431,100.869209|12.906008,100.869255|12.913666,100.870483|12.906116,100.869186|12.906928,100.869156|12.910278,100.869057|12.909987,100.866760|12.909722,100.868927|12.913518,100.870934&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.911690,100.871002|12.910459,100.868332|12.913719,100.867088|12.909583,100.865700|12.912065,100.868279|12.911870,100.870506|12.910868,100.872353|12.911315,100.864922|12.909760,100.871567&signature=3kVEH7fgCimuPXoHTkjOo2jWcSs="
