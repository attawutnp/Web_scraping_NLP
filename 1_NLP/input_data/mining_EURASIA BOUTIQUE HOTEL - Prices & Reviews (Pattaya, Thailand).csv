TomOrr wrote a review May 2018,40,OK for a night or two,"We picked this hotel for proximity to a health centre I was visiting and it turned out to be an OK choice. I think this is more of a residence than a hotel as we seemed to be the only paying guests. The rooms were clean and spacious and the staff friendly.    Breakfast was included and as 'the only internet guests' a table was set just for us and breakfast was a basic, but adequate choice of eggs, sausage and toast with tea, coffee and juice.    If I was in the area for the same reason i would stay agin but its not the most convenient for restaurants, bars and the more lively parts of Pattaya.","EURASIA BOUTIQUE HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.905870,100.919502&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.905870,100.919502|12.905870,100.919502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.909700,100.909737|12.909081,100.917610|12.895865,100.916069&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.907987,100.913330|12.908712,100.916000|12.906045,100.919914|12.907711,100.923569|12.915351,100.915169|12.909336,100.917068|12.911880,100.910713|12.914370,100.915359|12.909272,100.916809&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.912784,100.926170|12.911460,100.910713|12.911460,100.910713|12.912310,100.910667|12.912290,100.910667|12.907486,100.926155|12.911460,100.910713|12.898960,100.914268&signature=A41YVJRs_ge3w2ZKK3wEg2Fy6cg="

Jamie J wrote a review May 2014,40,Good Value,"I found Pattaya to be pretty expensive but this hotel was good value cost about 1000 baht a night stayed for 3 nights during the water fight festival. the hotel was about a 10 min walk to walking street which was where most of the action was.    The room was very big with a big bed which was very comfy air con was a lil slow but worked fine.  the bathroom was decent wit a big walk in shower which had a lil mold in some places but wasn't bad at all,    I found the hotel grounds to be nice and staff was friendly,The pool was decent maybe could do with some more sun lounges.    The only disappointment i thought was the breakfast but considering the price i have no complaints about this hotel.","EURASIA BOUTIQUE HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.905870,100.919502&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.905870,100.919502|12.905870,100.919502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.909700,100.909737|12.909081,100.917610|12.895865,100.916069&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.907987,100.913330|12.908712,100.916000|12.906045,100.919914|12.907711,100.923569|12.915351,100.915169|12.909336,100.917068|12.911880,100.910713|12.914370,100.915359|12.909272,100.916809&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.912784,100.926170|12.911460,100.910713|12.911460,100.910713|12.912310,100.910667|12.912290,100.910667|12.907486,100.926155|12.911460,100.910713|12.898960,100.914268&signature=A41YVJRs_ge3w2ZKK3wEg2Fy6cg="

We found out that in the room next door, the girl in the shower got shocked and felt unconscious. She ended at the hospital.    To our luck, it was our last day there. The staff gave us (and the couple next door) a free breakfast. WOW! you would have expected them to give us at least our stay free.

I think this is more of a residence than a hotel as we seemed to be the only paying guests. The rooms were clean and spacious and the staff friendly.    Breakfast was included and as 'the only internet guests' a table was set just for us and breakfast was a basic, but adequate choice of eggs, sausage and toast with tea, coffee and juice.

Jamie J wrote a review May 2014,40,Good Value,"I found Pattaya to be pretty expensive but this hotel was good value cost about 1000 baht a night stayed for 3 nights during the water fight festival. the hotel was about a 10 min walk to walking street which was where most of the action was.    The room was very big with a big bed which was very comfy air con was a lil slow but worked fine.  the bathroom was decent wit a big walk in shower which had a lil mold in some places but wasn't bad at all,    I found the hotel grounds to be nice and staff was friendly,The pool was decent maybe could do with some more sun lounges.    The only disappointment i thought was the breakfast but considering the price i have no complaints about this hotel.","EURASIA BOUTIQUE HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.905870,100.919502&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.905870,100.919502|12.905870,100.919502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.909700,100.909737|12.909081,100.917610|12.895865,100.916069&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.907987,100.913330|12.908712,100.916000|12.906045,100.919914|12.907711,100.923569|12.915351,100.915169|12.909336,100.917068|12.911880,100.910713|12.914370,100.915359|12.909272,100.916809&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.912784,100.926170|12.911460,100.910713|12.911460,100.910713|12.912310,100.910667|12.912290,100.910667|12.907486,100.926155|12.911460,100.910713|12.898960,100.914268&signature=A41YVJRs_ge3w2ZKK3wEg2Fy6cg="

A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Feb 2009,30,A Surprise with the Shower,"The hotel is nice and the staff is friendly. Now the horror story: I have my girlfriend get electrocuted in the shower. For some reason there was electricity in the water one night. She came out of it running like a bat out of hell. It was scary. We found out that in the room next door, the girl in the shower got shocked and felt unconscious. She ended at the hospital.    To our luck, it was our last day there. The staff gave us (and the couple next door) a free breakfast. WOW! you would have expected them to give us at least our stay free.

TomOrr wrote a review May 2018,40,OK for a night or two,"We picked this hotel for proximity to a health centre I was visiting and it turned out to be an OK choice. I think this is more of a residence than a hotel as we seemed to be the only paying guests. The rooms were clean and spacious and the staff friendly.    Breakfast was included and as 'the only internet guests' a table was set just for us and breakfast was a basic, but adequate choice of eggs, sausage and toast with tea, coffee and juice.    If I was in the area for the same reason i would stay agin but its not the most convenient for restaurants, bars and the more lively parts of Pattaya.","EURASIA BOUTIQUE HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.905870,100.919502&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.905870,100.919502|12.905870,100.919502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.909700,100.909737|12.909081,100.917610|12.895865,100.916069&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.907987,100.913330|12.908712,100.916000|12.906045,100.919914|12.907711,100.923569|12.915351,100.915169|12.909336,100.917068|12.911880,100.910713|12.914370,100.915359|12.909272,100.916809&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.912784,100.926170|12.911460,100.910713|12.911460,100.910713|12.912310,100.910667|12.912290,100.910667|12.907486,100.926155|12.911460,100.910713|12.898960,100.914268&signature=A41YVJRs_ge3w2ZKK3wEg2Fy6cg="

The problem is the location,although its only a 10/15 from walking street it is difficult to find, especially after a few beers, took me about 5 nights to nail the soi (its 16 or 17) that takes you from the walking street area to the hotel. Also there are very few bars near the hotel.

A Tripadvisor Member wrote a review Feb 2009,30,A Surprise with the Shower,"The hotel is nice and the staff is friendly. Now the horror story: I have my girlfriend get electrocuted in the shower. For some reason there was electricity in the water one night. She came out of it running like a bat out of hell. It was scary. We found out that in the room next door, the girl in the shower got shocked and felt unconscious. She ended at the hospital.    To our luck, it was our last day there. The staff gave us (and the couple next door) a free breakfast. WOW! you would have expected them to give us at least our stay free. The moral of the story, be careful of the electric water heaters wherever you go.","EURASIA BOUTIQUE HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.905870,100.919502&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.905870,100.919502|12.905870,100.919502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.909700,100.909737|12.909081,100.917610|12.895865,100.916069&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.907987,100.913330|12.908712,100.916000|12.906045,100.919914|12.907711,100.923569|12.915351,100.915169|12.909336,100.917068|12.911880,100.910713|12.914370,100.915359|12.909272,100.916809&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.912784,100.926170|12.911460,100.910713|12.911460,100.910713|12.912310,100.910667|12.912290,100.910667|12.907486,100.926155|12.911460,100.910713|12.898960,100.914268&signature=A41YVJRs_ge3w2ZKK3wEg2Fy6cg="
sgtrock wrote a review Oct 2008,40,service was great,"Eurasia Residence Hotel  Date 25Sept-10Oct 2008  Reviewer A trip adviser member Brisbane Australia.  I have just returned from Thailand, Pattaya and after staying at the Eurasia Residence hotel i cannot heap upon it the praise it deserves.These residence were just excellent in every way,from the time i arrived to the time i left.  I Was impress with the service, and the staff could not do enough for me.The only short fall was the breakfast menu it did not change the whole time I stayed there. Other than that I would recommend it to every one who would like a quite and pleasant place to stay.
