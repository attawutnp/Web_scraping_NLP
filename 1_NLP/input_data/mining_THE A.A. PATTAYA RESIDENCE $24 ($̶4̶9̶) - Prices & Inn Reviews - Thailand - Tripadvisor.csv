Love2jib wrote a review Apr 2016,40,Nice Central Located Hotel,I spent 5 nights at this hotel & I found it a pleasant place to stay. The location is in a good spot in central Pattaya & only about 2 minutes walking distance from the beach    My room was spacious & the bed was comfortable & I chose a cheaper room with no view but it was fine. The staff at the reception & the porter lads were really friendly.    There is a rooftop pool that also serves food & a buffet breakfast on offer which is value for money as it is cheap especially compared to nearby cafes etc.,THE A.A.

No bars you could hear noise from.The wifi is no good, it falls out all the time. The staff is all right but not the cleaning lady cause she steals from your wallet in pocket. Also I see that she wash the room at one time, and many hours later she unlocks her self in to the room, to fill up 2 bottles in the minibar. Unlucky for her I was at the room then. But the staff wont do anything about the stealing of money from the room. They just say that one should use the safety box they have downstairs. Stay away if you dont like thieves.",THE A.A.

Sirator wrote a review Jul 2014,20,Outdated,"When we arrived the hotel we were greeted by a pleasant but somewhat aloof staff. This remained so throughout our stay. I felt that maybe they were a little wary of possible complaints. Perhaps not without reason.    The lobby of the AA Hotel are large and well kept. Nostalgic interior and furnishings may be associated with an older fashionable hotel. And this increases the expectation of what will meet you when you arrive your hotel room.    But do not be fooled. The best one can say about the room was that the bed was big and good, with clean bedding. The interior in general, that were painted in a light beige color, did not seem to gotten a lick of paint since it was painted first, obviously many years ago.    The worst however was the bathroom. There was hot water in both the wash basin and the shower, at least for a while. Towards the end of the stay much of the hot water disappeared. The water pressure in the shower was ok. But when we arrived there was a heavy leak in the shower handle so you had to keep a hard grip on it to prevent the water to splash everywhere else than where it was supposed to go. Credit to staff though to fix this with a new shower handle the day after, when we pointed out the problem. But otherwise the bathroom was full of mold, and they had tried to hide the old mold by painting over the joints with white paint, which had run down the tiles, the bath and floor tiles. It needs a real upgrade.    Here you get no shampoo, shower cap, cotton buds etc. What you get is two of the little soap pieces one remember from 40-50 years ago.    The room is equipped with an old tube TV. There are some twenty channels with very variable picture quality. The room also has a mini bar in a well-used refrigerator. As if the whole offer was not sparse enough, they require 15 thb for a bottle of water. I can not remember having been in a hotel where two bottles of water a day were not included.    AC at the highest setting was barely strong enough to keep the temperature low enough.    The price for the room only was 1,000 thb. We did not try the breakfast, but according to previous reviews this is not a great experience.    The best one can say about AA Hotel's is good location and the swimming pool area on the fourth floor.    One will definitely be able to find better offers for the same or lower price in this area.",THE A.A.

Sebastian S wrote a review Jul 2014,10,Won't stay here again,"First of all, I have to say that I had total different expectation from Pattaya. It's a hot/humid beach city (not a small town but a city). There is no wind which makes the humidity unbearable, no waves at sea, and the beach water and sand is small and filthy. From morning till night there are hundreds, up to about a thousand of prostitutes wondering the beach boulevard. Not a safe place at night.    The AA hotel staff was great. Friendly, accomodating, and always willing to help out. The hotel property itseld if completely outdated and badly maintained. Swimming pool has missing tiles, risking to cut open your skin. The bedroom in general has been constructed very poorly, making it impossible for housekeeping ladies to maintain hygiene standards. Furniture dates back from the 80's?    I was planning to stay at least a week at this beach side resort, I left for the airport after 2 nights. Never again. Will never recommend it to anybody.",THE A.A.

FjkII wrote a review Feb 2014,20,Very disappointing,"I have stayed at the A A 5 or 6 times a year for the past few years and generally do not have a problem that was until last Friday. I reserved a room in the B building the previous Monday by telephone. On my arrival the receptionist told me there was no reservation and the only rooms available were suites in the B building (at a higher price) or rooms in the more inferior A Building. The person that took my reservation at first denied that I had called. The log on my phone confirmed the call. However, during the course of establishing where I was to stay she quoted parts of our conversation and then disappeared. When I challenged her again she agreed to the basic rate fot the suite and that I would have to move the next day. When I changed, the room had strong smells of cigarette and urine. This was dealt with by an air freshening spray. I asked to change the room but I was told the hotel was full. Despite my long patronage I felt my treatment was shoddy at the least. Suffice to say I moved to another hotel nearby and will not return to the A A.",THE A.A.

English-Chaai wrote a review Jan 2014,40,Good budget hotel!,"Good budget hotel. The standard room was spacious with plenty of storage, but no hangers in the closet. The cable TV is basic, but provides news and one movie channel. The hot water was intermittent during my stay. The room was cleaned and fresh towels provided daily. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location puts you 5 minutes walk from the beach, and a short baht bus ride to walking Street or the large shopping mall. The hotel is located near bars, so you will hear the sound of live bands until the early hours, however they did not disturb my sleep. I paid $35 a night (cash), a credit card would incur an additional $1 per day. The value, location and staff made this a positive stay, and I would return.",THE A.A.

Sandy and Charlie are both amazing people who run and head the staff at the hotel and they do an outstanding job. It may be old and outdated as some other bloke was having a sad about in a review I read but it is still an Excellent Resort. The rooftop pool is awesome!

No WIFI. ! just can use the computer in lobby if you pay for them. No safe box in rooms.  they have 2 swimming pools. its not a bad hotel if the traveller is on a budget.

amitab10 wrote a review Mar 2010,40,Offering so much for so little,"I have been coming back to this hotel since 2003.Back in 2003 I just went to this hotel for Bhat80 breakfast buffet. I liked the decor,I liked the food,and the service. Then I felt tempted to see the room when the receptionist invited me to do so for my next round's stay/visit to Pattaya. I liked the wooden panelled bedroom so much that I decided to move in next couple of hours.The rate was Bhat700. Now a brand new wing has been added to this hotel with room rates ranging from Bhat1000 to Bhat 1400. The rooms in the old wing range from Bhat800 to Bhat1200. Originally they had a swimming pool in the roof (8th floor). Now they have another one on the first floor of the new wing. In ground floor restaurant buffet breakfast consisting of English and Thai food cost around Bhat90. Egg dishes are served freshly cooked.For bacon they charge Bhat30 extra. Service is excellent and seems to come from heart. Same applies to room service and poolside service. Rooms are spacious and so are the bathrooms/toilets. Bed sheets are changed daily and so are superior quality towels. There is adequately stocked minibar in each room. Safe deposit lockers are available. But 8am to 8pm are operating times.If you are checking out early it is important to clear the locker before 8pm on the previous evening.Overall standard of security is very good.Coming to location, the hotel is very conveniently placed in terms of local amenities- bars,nightclubs,shopping malls,massage parlours,internet cafes,beauty parlours, and you just name it. Two minutes walk will take you to sea front. The hotel reflects ,and maintains,an image of magnificience and respectability.As you enter the hotel or go to the dinning room you may be forgiven for thinking that it is a 4* establishment. As to value for your money you are unlikely to come across another hotel in Pattaya offering so much for so little in terms of comforts and safety. Hotel runs a very efficient and reliable airport transfer service,and again at a very reasonable rate.The travel agency operating from the hotel will look after all your travel and entertainment needs.Only draw back that I can think of is that none of the hotel rooms is sea facing. You can view the sea from either ends of hotel corridors on each floor.This apart you will love the hotel,all its amenities and above all its friendly staff.",THE A.A.
