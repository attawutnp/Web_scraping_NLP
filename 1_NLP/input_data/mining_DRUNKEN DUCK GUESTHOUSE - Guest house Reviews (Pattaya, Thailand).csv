Good shower, clean room and cable TV and wifi. What makes the Drunken Duck special for me are the people that worked there. They bent over backwards to make sure I was conformable and all my needs were met. The ladies that work there are very friendly and some can give you a dang good game of pool. Haha! you know whom I'm talking about. It starts with good management with Sassy who has the respect of her co-workers and that's because she respects them.

PattayaRegular wrote a review Feb 2014,30,Take the rough with the smooth,"I stayed at the Duck for a week as my other hotel had let me down in terms of being double booked. I was familiar with the Soi LK area and its emerging nightlife.  I called into the Duck one evening and asked for a weeks accommodation from the following day. The staff on the bar are very helpful and cheerful and showed me the available room and took a deposit which was returned at the end of my stay.  I was allocated Room 3 at the rear which whilst quiet is a very small room with ill fitting curtains and a bed which must date back to 1970. The springs were very uncomfortable and I realised rapidly that a seven night stay would be seven nights too long. However, I decided to give it a go and try one night in Room 3 which was not pleasant.  The following day I requested a room change and the only available room was Room 1, a much bigger room overlooking Soi LK. This was much better and he room was considerably bigger but I did notice that the window was very ill-fitting and someone could easily have entered the room byclimbing onto the balcony and sliding open the window.The bed, whilst not as bad as Room 3, also needs replacing. However, the room was kept clean, it had good AC and a tiled floor with in-room safe and a fridge. I was concerned about the noise but I was surprised that whilst the hotel is on Soi LK it was not as noisy as I expected and had no problem sleeping. However, one night, I got no sleep as there was an all night party in a 'golf' bar opposite, presumably Americans watching the overnight superbowl. It was incredibly noisy until 7am which there is little the management for this guesthouse can be held accountable for.  My room in the bigger room was 1000 a night which I think is probably the maximum they could charge. Room 3, the smaller room whould be refurbished as it is not worth more than 500 baht in my view.  The bar and hotel is clean, cheery and friendly with helpful staff. Deposits are returned and a problem I had one evening relating to an electric problem was dealt with speedily. I think a weeks stay here is probably enough. The manager/owner appears visible which is reassuring.","DRUNKEN DUCK GUESTHOUSE - Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929804,100.885445&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929804,100.885445&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930492,100.889503&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391|12.928204,100.885674&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589|12.929615,100.883430&signature=QC8GdgP4cDho6rAuzJLIdRnuO4Q="

I met the owner of the so called hotel while he was fighting with his wife, I called my friend and he collected me at 5am to go and stay at his house, never did see Tony?

Peter_n_Esther wrote a review Feb 2013,30,Cheap and cheerful,"Walked in off the street after being let down somewhere else locally and was made welcome immediately. We would have slept anywhere the first night after a long journey by road/ferry from Koh Chang but were pleasantly suprised at how spacious the room was, and the minimum of fuss at checking in. The room was cleaned every day and fresh towels were supplied. The (optional) breakfast was enjoyable, though there are also plenty of alternatives within walking distance. Not the type of place to take children for a family holiday but ideal for couples or solo travellers. Within walking distance of all amenities including the beach. All in all a pleasant experience and would certainly return at a later date.","DRUNKEN DUCK GUESTHOUSE - Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929804,100.885445&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929804,100.885445&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930492,100.889503&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391|12.928204,100.885674&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589|12.929615,100.883430&signature=QC8GdgP4cDho6rAuzJLIdRnuO4Q="

You spent a while one night whinging to me that you chose this bar because of reviews on here and were very miffed that Tony was not there to molly coddle you  If you were desperate for information Tony was ALWAYS available to call and the staff could speak English and help you in any way necessary.  I suggest your review is mainly garbage but will find out pretty soon as i will stay at the bar as a guest next time instead of just using it as a leisure place  Best of luck on your next holiday - and brush up your pool!!

Ed T wrote a review Jan 2013,20,Not for me,"I stayed at this guesthouse for 16 days in Nov/Dec 2012. I knew going in that it would be noisy at night but was surprised at just how much noise and for how long. I was never able to sleep before 3:30 a.m.  The problem for me is that in the 16 nights I stayed there, my sheets were only changed once, and the bed was only made approximately 4 times. Several days I went without garbage being emptied (although it wasn't full). 14 of the 16 days, staff were in my room, yet they only left water and towels most days. There was a large cobweb in the bathroom that was never cleaned.  This is the first of many reviews I have done on Agoda and Trip Advisor that I have stated that I would not stay at a hotel again. I would not stay here again.  The staff were friendly and fun, but the rooms were not cleaned and dirty.","DRUNKEN DUCK GUESTHOUSE - Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929804,100.885445&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929804,100.885445&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930492,100.889503&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391|12.928204,100.885674&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589|12.929615,100.883430&signature=QC8GdgP4cDho6rAuzJLIdRnuO4Q="

Ariel S wrote a review Oct 2012,50,"Great location, very clean, nice staff","This was a great choice. The location is on a street full of go go bars (what rhey call a strip club) but the street was nice, clean and not the disgusting feeling these areas have in other cities. We are a maried couple and we tried every go go club on the street. Our favorite was Queen just around the corner :)  The rooms were very nice and clean. We ordered a superior room but it was on the 4th floor with no elevator so we asked to move to a regular room on 2nd floor. Was perfect, no need for a bigger room. Good a/c and hot water.  The matress wasn't the best I've slept on and there is a little bit of noise from the clubs (very little) as expected in a location like this.  We met the owner Tonny briefly and he showed us the area on the map and gave us recomondations. He also offered us drinks on the house. He lives in Pattaya for 8 years and knows the place well. Very nice guy.  It's not walking distance from Pattaya walking street but we went there 1 night and honestly this street is better imo...

The surrounding area is an up and coming area of Pattaya, you dont need to take many steps once outside the door for restaurants, bars and entertainment.

P.M. wrote a review Oct 2011,50,Another outstanding stay in a perfect location,"The Drunken Duck is a great place to stay in one of the best locations in Pattaya - Soi LK Metro. This was my third visit and I stayed in Room#1 - which overlooked Soi LK Metro. The room was nicely furnished in a modern style, with balcony, a/c, large fridge, ensuite, wall mounted safe, wall mounted LCD TV and DVD player. The bed was firm (which I prefer) and I slept soundly each night I was there. Noise from the street was not noticeable after 2am - if you prefer a quieter room they have some on the backside of the building. The ensuite is your standard combined guesthouse style toilet/shower with sink.    The Drunken Duck is owned/managed by Tony - an outgoing and courteous gent from England - who's always willing to head out with you into the city for a drink and will show you the best places in town. Then there's Bobby, who organises pub crawls to other towns in the vicinity of Pattaya and loves to have a drink. The staff at the Drunken Duck (Ann - supervisor; Lee - night cashier; Nid - day cashier and the cleaning ladies) are friendly, cheerful and helpful. The cleaning ladies do a top job on the rooms everyday and can be trusted with your belongings in your room.    The Drunken Duck does not currently have an operational kitchen/restaurant - though I heard some plans are in the works to get one running in the future. However, there is a selection of menu's from local restaurants in the bar and you can place your food order with the cashier/bartender and it will be delivered to The Drunken Duck quickly. I highly recommend breakfast from the Golf Club (located across the Soi).    I like returning to stay at The Drunken Duck as I am welcomed back as family and treated as such during my stay. I cannot recommend this place enough!","DRUNKEN DUCK GUESTHOUSE - Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929804,100.885445&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929804,100.885445&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930492,100.889503&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391|12.928204,100.885674&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589|12.929615,100.883430&signature=QC8GdgP4cDho6rAuzJLIdRnuO4Q="

Big rooms, reasonable rates, helpful staff, perfect location with some of the best places to eat and drink in Pattaya on your door step, many of which deliver to the Drunken Duck.  The owner will go out of his way with recommendations and advice for visitors and he even arranges bar crawl trips.    Top tip is that Drunken Duck stocks electolyte powers and serves then to any hangover victims, couple of those work wonders if you like a heavy night!    If you want a guesthouse in Pattaya this should be your first choice!","DRUNKEN DUCK GUESTHOUSE - Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929804,100.885445&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929804,100.885445&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930492,100.889503&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391|12.928204,100.885674&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589|12.929615,100.883430&signature=QC8GdgP4cDho6rAuzJLIdRnuO4Q="
