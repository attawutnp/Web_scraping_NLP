M Ng wrote a review Jan 2022,40,"Will return, Decent Facilities, Reasonably priced, Great Views","I would recommend and come back again    The views are amazing and a great location, the staff are decent and try their best, which I appreciated.    Facilities are good, and there are decent options for children with a kid's pool on level 2. Good for couples, or families and reasonably priced.    The suites would be great for hosting a decent sized group to celebrate the new year.    The decor is Thai Traditional and not modern decor, so don't expect that. Some design flaws are clearly stated, but can be overlooked due to the rest of the facilities.    Atmosphere is relaxed and if you don't expect 5 star anything goes, at 5 star prices you'll be satisfied.    Understand the staff enforces hotel policies, so they don't have the leeway to cater to all requests. Expect to pay for additional add-ons which may be clearly stated in your booking policies.","ROYAL HERITAGE PAVILION, JOMTIEN - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.933170,100.917740&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.933170,100.917740|12.933170,100.917740&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.939422,100.916946|12.924349,100.912750|12.927270,100.911430|12.928980,100.907600|12.928740,100.919090|12.928947,100.927010|12.934240,100.917801|12.933230,100.922501|12.929286,100.927818&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.937746,100.912216|12.924420,100.922737|12.932660,100.918221|12.941370,100.913307|12.933840,100.918198|12.931430,100.908180|12.925570,100.913460|12.926250,100.919441&signature=tUF_fGsE0mpCBnZHSOq1tASmNQo="

Fastidious wrote a review Jan 2019,20,Tired and in need of refurbishment,"A very tired and shabby hotel, in need of renovation. Don’t be deceived by the photos on the website.    Pool area, although on the roof offering good views, was old and required refurbishment.    The bed was uncomfortable, with old sheets and a thin duvet. The pillows were worn out and you needed three instead of one as they were so thin.    The breakfast was poor, with little choice. Very slow replenishment of the buffet-style food and most of it cold.    Restaurant floor dirty, as were the tables.    To sum up: an old, overpriced hotel that needs a full make-over.","ROYAL HERITAGE PAVILION, JOMTIEN - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.933170,100.917740&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.933170,100.917740|12.933170,100.917740&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.939422,100.916946|12.924349,100.912750|12.927270,100.911430|12.928980,100.907600|12.928740,100.919090|12.928947,100.927010|12.934240,100.917801|12.933230,100.922501|12.929286,100.927818&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.937746,100.912216|12.924420,100.922737|12.932660,100.918221|12.941370,100.913307|12.933840,100.918198|12.931430,100.908180|12.925570,100.913460|12.926250,100.919441&signature=tUF_fGsE0mpCBnZHSOq1tASmNQo="

Greg A wrote a review Jun 2016,30,Quite a good option.,"My lovely wife and I stayed here in late March. In general it was a good stay and we would definitely consider staying here again.  The hotel is in a good location, across the road from the beach. It is a reasonably quiet area, however not too far to walk or jump on the baht bus for a bit of nightlife etc  There were issues with wifi for 2 days but eventually sorted.  Our rate included breakfast. To be honest, the breakfast was below par.  Overall it was a good stay. Would recommend hotel to others.

Tazza72 wrote a review May 2016,20,Did they give themselves 4 stars?,"This is not a 4 star hotel or even close to it. At best it would be a 2 1/2 stars. The staff are rude and the fact I am in the land of smiles and yet to see one at the Royal Heritage just about sums it up. Avoid if you can. The rooms have no real amenities like tea or coffee which you would expect from a 4* hotel. We had to call room service back 3 times to clean the bathroom enough for us to go in it.    There is not a single working umbrella in the hotel so you either sit in the boiling hot sun or your room - not a single piece of shade anywhere.    I have stayed in lots of hotels all over Thailand and some of them have been extremely basic but the friendly staff have been a redeeming feature or the clean rooms or excellent breakfast etc.    This hotel does not have a single redeeming feature all the drinks are overpriced the service is poor, the food is poor, the rooms are dirty the pool is dirty (yesterday there were floating cigarette's in the pool) and the debris around the edge of the pool has been there for the last couple of days that we have been here.........

davjav wrote a review Mar 2016,30,Ok for the money,"Just spent 2 weeks here and after the lack of reviews on here and worrying reviews on agodo really felt we had booked a really poor hotel.  We arrived around 9 pm and were met with chaos on reception and a few cats so didn't start well. We then had to pay 1000 bhat to cover the mini bar. We then were given wifi codes and advised breakfast vouchers would be issued, we did not book breakfast so this was a bonus.    We got to the room and the key didn't work.it's a contactless card type so had to get it reprogrammed we were told a additional key would have an extra charge so didn't bother,the room was of a good size on the 9th floor with secluded balcony and sea view. The room could have done with more storage and hangers but was ok. The bathroom was nice size but could have had a deep clean around the shower edges where it was quite mouldy. The shower itself was brilliant though really powerful and hot. The air con in the room was also excellent.  As the first day passed and we got to find our bearings we really liked the hotel position just across the road from the beach and close to local restaurant and shops.. The 10bhat bus was easy to use as well although the didn't alllways go up as far up as the hotel so sometimes had to walk some of the way back but not a problem.    At times I think we were the only guests in the hotel and at weekends it was packed mainly with Asian tourists .  The pools were nice but started to go green on 2nd week so we didn't use them. Also the gym was closed but we never wanted to use that. A bar would have been nice but there are many close by.    Overall the hotel is fine but the beds were quite hard, the rooms were however cleaned daily and 2 bottles of water delivered each day Which was nice.    I would not rate it as a 4 star but for the price we paid was more than acceptable. Although we had breakfast vouchers we never used them as always got up too late and missed it.    As we checked our in the early hours the 1000 bhat was returned as we didn't use the mini bar. The security guard though was fast asleep as we left so waste of time him being on duty    Ideal as a base and if you get a good deal worth booking this hotel but it's not a high service hotel.","ROYAL HERITAGE PAVILION, JOMTIEN - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.933170,100.917740&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.933170,100.917740|12.933170,100.917740&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.939422,100.916946|12.924349,100.912750|12.927270,100.911430|12.928980,100.907600|12.928740,100.919090|12.928947,100.927010|12.934240,100.917801|12.933230,100.922501|12.929286,100.927818&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.937746,100.912216|12.924420,100.922737|12.932660,100.918221|12.941370,100.913307|12.933840,100.918198|12.931430,100.908180|12.925570,100.913460|12.926250,100.919441&signature=tUF_fGsE0mpCBnZHSOq1tASmNQo="

M Ng wrote a review Jan 2022,40,"Will return, Decent Facilities, Reasonably priced, Great Views","I would recommend and come back again    The views are amazing and a great location, the staff are decent and try their best, which I appreciated.    Facilities are good, and there are decent options for children with a kid's pool on level 2. Good for couples, or families and reasonably priced.    The suites would be great for hosting a decent sized group to celebrate the new year.    The decor is Thai Traditional and not modern decor, so don't expect that. Some design flaws are clearly stated, but can be overlooked due to the rest of the facilities.    Atmosphere is relaxed and if you don't expect 5 star anything goes, at 5 star prices you'll be satisfied.    Understand the staff enforces hotel policies, so they don't have the leeway to cater to all requests. Expect to pay for additional add-ons which may be clearly stated in your booking policies.","ROYAL HERITAGE PAVILION, JOMTIEN - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.933170,100.917740&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.933170,100.917740|12.933170,100.917740&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.939422,100.916946|12.924349,100.912750|12.927270,100.911430|12.928980,100.907600|12.928740,100.919090|12.928947,100.927010|12.934240,100.917801|12.933230,100.922501|12.929286,100.927818&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.937746,100.912216|12.924420,100.922737|12.932660,100.918221|12.941370,100.913307|12.933840,100.918198|12.931430,100.908180|12.925570,100.913460|12.926250,100.919441&signature=tUF_fGsE0mpCBnZHSOq1tASmNQo="

Fastidious wrote a review Jan 2019,20,Tired and in need of refurbishment,"A very tired and shabby hotel, in need of renovation. Don’t be deceived by the photos on the website.    Pool area, although on the roof offering good views, was old and required refurbishment.    The bed was uncomfortable, with old sheets and a thin duvet. The pillows were worn out and you needed three instead of one as they were so thin.    The breakfast was poor, with little choice. Very slow replenishment of the buffet-style food and most of it cold.    Restaurant floor dirty, as were the tables.

The hotel is in a good location, across the road from the beach. It is a reasonably quiet area, however not too far to walk or jump on the baht bus for a bit of nightlife etc  There were issues with wifi for 2 days but eventually sorted.  Our rate included breakfast. To be honest, the breakfast was below par.  Overall it was a good stay. Would recommend hotel to others.

The rooms have no real amenities like tea or coffee which you would expect from a 4* hotel. We had to call room service back 3 times to clean the bathroom enough for us to go in it.    There is not a single working umbrella in the hotel so you either sit in the boiling hot sun or your room - not a single piece of shade anywhere.

davjav wrote a review Mar 2016,30,Ok for the money,"Just spent 2 weeks here and after the lack of reviews on here and worrying reviews on agodo really felt we had booked a really poor hotel.  We arrived around 9 pm and were met with chaos on reception and a few cats so didn't start well. We then had to pay 1000 bhat to cover the mini bar. We then were given wifi codes and advised breakfast vouchers would be issued, we did not book breakfast so this was a bonus.    We got to the room and the key didn't work.it's a contactless card type so had to get it reprogrammed we were told a additional key would have an extra charge so didn't bother,the room was of a good size on the 9th floor with secluded balcony and sea view. The room could have done with more storage and hangers but was ok. The bathroom was nice size but could have had a deep clean around the shower edges where it was quite mouldy. The shower itself was brilliant though really powerful and hot. The air con in the room was also excellent.  As the first day passed and we got to find our bearings we really liked the hotel position just across the road from the beach and close to local restaurant and shops.. The 10bhat bus was easy to use as well although the didn't alllways go up as far up as the hotel so sometimes had to walk some of the way back but not a problem.    At times I think we were the only guests in the hotel and at weekends it was packed mainly with Asian tourists .  The pools were nice but started to go green on 2nd week so we didn't use them. Also the gym was closed but we never wanted to use that. A bar would have been nice but there are many close by.    Overall the hotel is fine but the beds were quite hard, the rooms were however cleaned daily and 2 bottles of water delivered each day Which was nice.    I would not rate it as a 4 star but for the price we paid was more than acceptable. Although we had breakfast vouchers we never used them as always got up too late and missed it.    As we checked our in the early hours the 1000 bhat was returned as we didn't use the mini bar. The security guard though was fast asleep as we left so waste of time him being on duty    Ideal as a base and if you get a good deal worth booking this hotel but it's not a high service hotel.","ROYAL HERITAGE PAVILION, JOMTIEN - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.933170,100.917740&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.933170,100.917740|12.933170,100.917740&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.939422,100.916946|12.924349,100.912750|12.927270,100.911430|12.928980,100.907600|12.928740,100.919090|12.928947,100.927010|12.934240,100.917801|12.933230,100.922501|12.929286,100.927818&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.937746,100.912216|12.924420,100.922737|12.932660,100.918221|12.941370,100.913307|12.933840,100.918198|12.931430,100.908180|12.925570,100.913460|12.926250,100.919441&signature=tUF_fGsE0mpCBnZHSOq1tASmNQo="

M Ng wrote a review Jan 2022,40,"Will return, Decent Facilities, Reasonably priced, Great Views","I would recommend and come back again    The views are amazing and a great location, the staff are decent and try their best, which I appreciated.    Facilities are good, and there are decent options for children with a kid's pool on level 2. Good for couples, or families and reasonably priced.    The suites would be great for hosting a decent sized group to celebrate the new year.    The decor is Thai Traditional and not modern decor, so don't expect that. Some design flaws are clearly stated, but can be overlooked due to the rest of the facilities.    Atmosphere is relaxed and if you don't expect 5 star anything goes, at 5 star prices you'll be satisfied.    Understand the staff enforces hotel policies, so they don't have the leeway to cater to all requests. Expect to pay for additional add-ons which may be clearly stated in your booking policies.","ROYAL HERITAGE PAVILION, JOMTIEN - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.933170,100.917740&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.933170,100.917740|12.933170,100.917740&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.939422,100.916946|12.924349,100.912750|12.927270,100.911430|12.928980,100.907600|12.928740,100.919090|12.928947,100.927010|12.934240,100.917801|12.933230,100.922501|12.929286,100.927818&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.937746,100.912216|12.924420,100.922737|12.932660,100.918221|12.941370,100.913307|12.933840,100.918198|12.931430,100.908180|12.925570,100.913460|12.926250,100.919441&signature=tUF_fGsE0mpCBnZHSOq1tASmNQo="

Fastidious wrote a review Jan 2019,20,Tired and in need of refurbishment,"A very tired and shabby hotel, in need of renovation. Don’t be deceived by the photos on the website.    Pool area, although on the roof offering good views, was old and required refurbishment.    The bed was uncomfortable, with old sheets and a thin duvet. The pillows were worn out and you needed three instead of one as they were so thin.    The breakfast was poor, with little choice. Very slow replenishment of the buffet-style food and most of it cold.    Restaurant floor dirty, as were the tables.

The hotel is in a good location, across the road from the beach. It is a reasonably quiet area, however not too far to walk or jump on the baht bus for a bit of nightlife etc  There were issues with wifi for 2 days but eventually sorted.  Our rate included breakfast. To be honest, the breakfast was below par.  Overall it was a good stay. Would recommend hotel to others.

Tazza72 wrote a review May 2016,20,Did they give themselves 4 stars?,"This is not a 4 star hotel or even close to it. At best it would be a 2 1/2 stars. The staff are rude and the fact I am in the land of smiles and yet to see one at the Royal Heritage just about sums it up. Avoid if you can. The rooms have no real amenities like tea or coffee which you would expect from a 4* hotel. We had to call room service back 3 times to clean the bathroom enough for us to go in it.    There is not a single working umbrella in the hotel so you either sit in the boiling hot sun or your room - not a single piece of shade anywhere.    I have stayed in lots of hotels all over Thailand and some of them have been extremely basic but the friendly staff have been a redeeming feature or the clean rooms or excellent breakfast etc.    This hotel does not have a single redeeming feature all the drinks are overpriced the service is poor, the food is poor, the rooms are dirty the pool is dirty (yesterday there were floating cigarette's in the pool) and the debris around the edge of the pool has been there for the last couple of days that we have been here.........    Better options available at better prices so don't bother - looks like they have big tour parties so have completely given up on customer service.","ROYAL HERITAGE PAVILION, JOMTIEN - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.933170,100.917740&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.933170,100.917740|12.933170,100.917740&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.939422,100.916946|12.924349,100.912750|12.927270,100.911430|12.928980,100.907600|12.928740,100.919090|12.928947,100.927010|12.934240,100.917801|12.933230,100.922501|12.929286,100.927818&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.937746,100.912216|12.924420,100.922737|12.932660,100.918221|12.941370,100.913307|12.933840,100.918198|12.931430,100.908180|12.925570,100.913460|12.926250,100.919441&signature=tUF_fGsE0mpCBnZHSOq1tASmNQo="

Only interested in their mobile Phone and the buss loads of Chinese comming in every day. Tried to deliver laundry, but it would cost 2 days and 10 (!!!) Times the price of the laundry around the corner. When I wanted to speak to the manager about another issue I could only reach him by Email. I wrote an email but of course no reply. ....

davjav wrote a review Mar 2016,30,Ok for the money,"Just spent 2 weeks here and after the lack of reviews on here and worrying reviews on agodo really felt we had booked a really poor hotel.  We arrived around 9 pm and were met with chaos on reception and a few cats so didn't start well. We then had to pay 1000 bhat to cover the mini bar. We then were given wifi codes and advised breakfast vouchers would be issued, we did not book breakfast so this was a bonus.    We got to the room and the key didn't work.it's a contactless card type so had to get it reprogrammed we were told a additional key would have an extra charge so didn't bother,the room was of a good size on the 9th floor with secluded balcony and sea view. The room could have done with more storage and hangers but was ok. The bathroom was nice size but could have had a deep clean around the shower edges where it was quite mouldy. The shower itself was brilliant though really powerful and hot. The air con in the room was also excellent.  As the first day passed and we got to find our bearings we really liked the hotel position just across the road from the beach and close to local restaurant and shops.. The 10bhat bus was easy to use as well although the didn't alllways go up as far up as the hotel so sometimes had to walk some of the way back but not a problem.    At times I think we were the only guests in the hotel and at weekends it was packed mainly with Asian tourists .  The pools were nice but started to go green on 2nd week so we didn't use them. Also the gym was closed but we never wanted to use that. A bar would have been nice but there are many close by.    Overall the hotel is fine but the beds were quite hard, the rooms were however cleaned daily and 2 bottles of water delivered each day Which was nice.    I would not rate it as a 4 star but for the price we paid was more than acceptable. Although we had breakfast vouchers we never used them as always got up too late and missed it.    As we checked our in the early hours the 1000 bhat was returned as we didn't use the mini bar. The security guard though was fast asleep as we left so waste of time him being on duty    Ideal as a base and if you get a good deal worth booking this hotel but it's not a high service hotel.","ROYAL HERITAGE PAVILION, JOMTIEN - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.933170,100.917740&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.933170,100.917740|12.933170,100.917740&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.939422,100.916946|12.924349,100.912750|12.927270,100.911430|12.928980,100.907600|12.928740,100.919090|12.928947,100.927010|12.934240,100.917801|12.933230,100.922501|12.929286,100.927818&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.937746,100.912216|12.924420,100.922737|12.932660,100.918221|12.941370,100.913307|12.933840,100.918198|12.931430,100.908180|12.925570,100.913460|12.926250,100.919441&signature=tUF_fGsE0mpCBnZHSOq1tASmNQo="
