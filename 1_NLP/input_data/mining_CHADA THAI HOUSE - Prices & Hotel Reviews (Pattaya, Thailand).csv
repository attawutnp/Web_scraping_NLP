DeepDev wrote a review Jun 2016,50,Super friendly hotel,"We did a lot of online hotel hunting & finally we booked this hotel and bingo, we got what we wanted. Me and my friends stayed here for 3N.    The hotel is located at the end of an alley. Just outside there are 2 7eleven around the corner. The hotel is quiet considering that it's located in Pattaya.    Pattaya sleeps very late and there is loud music everywhere but you will not hear loud music once the doors are closed. Hotel is very close to beach road, walking street, local market, taxi stand & other important places.    Room was very clean, ventilated, big and comfortable. Beds were soft and comfortable. The receptionist girls & the staff was very friendly. They were also very helpful in giving us directions and helping us out in anything we needed. For the price we paid, we were very satisfied.

Zoe R wrote a review May 2016,50,Much better than any other hotel in pattaya,"We walked in without a reservation after we had seen this hotel online and they offered us even a cheaper price than expected:)  And the room was great! Pretty big with everything in it that you need, very comfortable bed and a nice balcony with a table to sit at.    Hotel is located right in the center of pattaya at the end of a sideroad. This location could not be better, because this way you are able to walk everywhere but also get to sleep well in the very quiet room where you can not hear any noices from the bars when you close the window.    Also staff is very friendly and the hotel looks very nice, havent seen any other cute hotels in pattaya!  Anyway pattaya is not a nice city, worst place i have seen in thailand!

jonfox wrote a review Mar 2016,50,It's the Calm within the Storm!,"You wouldn't believe you were amongst all the nightlife when you stay here. The hotel is so quiet yet 2 mins walk away is the hustle and bustle of Soi Dianna and LK Metro.  I've stayed in Pattaya over 20 times and I can honestly say this is the best hotel I've had in 10 year.  The staff are always smiling and it's a traditional Thai style hotel, no western culture to be seen which is a bonus when you in Thailand, the whole hotel was spotless and modern.  It seemed to have couples and single people staying when I was there but you hardly ever see anyone cos the hotel only has 20 rooms over 5 floors so it's very private.  Never stayed at the same place twice in Pattaya but I think that's just changed.

Basic rooms as you would expect, staff very friendly, not much more to say, only that I will be back, which is my highest recommendation.

RG23 wrote a review Jan 2015,40,"Quiet, clean and cosy!","Stayed here for 5 nights in December 2014.  Greeted with a big smile by the owner, in fact he smiled every time we met.  Room was very clean and the bed so soft and comfortable. The bathroom was beautiful with quality shower and decor. And a little balcony outside with table and chairs for chilling out.  Good location, only 2 minute walk to Second Road but just far enough away for a quiet nights sleep. Beach Road about a 5-10 minute walk.  Lovely place and friendly staff.  Only reason for not giving 5 stars ... thin curtains so bright in the morning. Blackout curtains would be better.","CHADA THAI HOUSE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929814,100.882614&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929814,100.882614&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.931667,100.879440|12.930410,100.879868|12.931495,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.933609,100.881073|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774&signature=2l7JF5Dddwv1wJAR70388HHyMKg="

This hotel is great,the rooms are fantastic and spacious and were only really just below par with my 4* hotel in BKK !  we stayed in room 213,was a great twin room with a balcony.  the hotel is set within tress at the end of the road and looks very nice,it is a 5-10 min walk up to walking street but that makes it a quiet location.  the staff were very friendly with us and helped us out on our return to Bangkok.  i still cant believe we stayed in such a nice hotel for such a low price.

dominique756 wrote a review May 2014,40,Very nice retreat,"I have spent one night in this small hotel, tucked away from the bustling Second Road, at the end of a Soi. Nice people at reception desk, elevator, beautiful bedroom decorated with Thai style furniture, flat screen TV with international channels, large and comfortable bed (effectively, as told by a previous contributor, the pillows are rather big, but no problem for me). and a large balcony with table and benchs.  No breakfast was served (but in was 1st of May, which may be the reason). Several options nearby make the deal.  A lot of restaurants and shops around, and the famous Villa Market supermarket at 3 minutes walk.  A very good experience at a correct price.","CHADA THAI HOUSE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929814,100.882614&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929814,100.882614&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.931667,100.879440|12.930410,100.879868|12.931495,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.933609,100.881073|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774&signature=2l7JF5Dddwv1wJAR70388HHyMKg="

Comfy bed, clean bathroom, even a balcony with tables and chairs outside. I haven't had to take a motorcycle taxi anywhere as you can walk to the beach in about 5 min, 15 min to walking street or central festival. There are about 20 rooms and it seems to be family run, with helpful staff. Try and get a high floor for a bit better view. for 1200 baht per night, you can't go wrong.","CHADA THAI HOUSE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929814,100.882614&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929814,100.882614&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.931667,100.879440|12.930410,100.879868|12.931495,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.933609,100.881073|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774&signature=2l7JF5Dddwv1wJAR70388HHyMKg="
digicloud wrote a review Feb 2014,40,Grows on you....Superb!,"I have to admit when we booked into this hotel I did not get a warm and fuzzy feeling. But it certainly grew on us and have to admit for a 3 or less star accommodation it was fantastic. Now keep in mind that they have breakfast but I can not speak to it as we were out every morning for breakfast as there were so many places around.  This hotel is located at the end of the street and from our room we could see the pool at the Areca Lodge, just over the wall and adjacent. The only thing we did not like was the place next door, which was a very dirty residence of some kind with lots of garbage around and very suspicious looking characters. What a pity as it really ruined the street to be honest but not a reflection at all on this hotel.  Staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs, whether day or night. We were on the fifth floor and the room was more than pleasant with a great bed. Laundry facilities were a couple of doors over just outside the hotel and from what we saw, probably the best rate with some awesome people working there.  And as I mentioned very central and convenient to the malls, bars and restaurants. it would have been nice to have a pool...but no complaints as we went to the beach. In fact we booked elsewhere in Pattaya for the last leg of our trip but in retrospect would have preferred to stay here. Management and staff were absolutely outstanding in every way!","CHADA THAI HOUSE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929814,100.882614&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929814,100.882614&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.931667,100.879440|12.930410,100.879868|12.931495,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.933609,100.881073|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774&signature=2l7JF5Dddwv1wJAR70388HHyMKg="

baggy67 wrote a review Jan 2014,40,Excellent small hotel,"Excellent small hotel tucked down the end of a lane,situated next to the large Intimate Hotel (formerly Tim Boutique).Chada Thai is quite charming.A decent sized bedroom with wooden floors,modern bathroom with a good shower with quality fittings.The bed,well once you have slept on some of the rock hard slabs in Pattaya you will really appreciate this one.Large LCD tv,with fast internet in the room.Small balcony with a table & a couple of chairs.Balcony's are attached to each other though so not the last word in privacy.The only criticism I have is that the sun shines through the curtains in the morning,they could do with a double set.But on the plus side,the room was super quiet,quite an achievement in crazy Pattaya,and not to be underestimated.A laundry is right outside the door,handy.Friendly staff that don't intrude,the maid seems to be cleaning continuously,and a big plus point is they don't use walkie talkies that can wake you up,they don't bang on your door all the time to clean the room,and because there are only 20 rooms,doors don't bang all night.Pricewise it is on the fringe of getting pricey as there is no pool,but highly recommended nonetheless!","CHADA THAI HOUSE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929814,100.882614&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929814,100.882614&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.931667,100.879440|12.930410,100.879868|12.931495,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.933609,100.881073|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774&signature=2l7JF5Dddwv1wJAR70388HHyMKg="
SooSteelers wrote a review Sep 2013,40,Nice Hotel,"The hotel is nice, clean and the rooms are good. The room has a great bathroom with plenty of hot water and more pressure than most other places I have stayed in Thailand. The hotel is a little hard to find if you do not know the area but once found you will see how easy it is to access and how close it is to the action. There is a nice flat screen tv in the room. The curtains are not the black out type and there is a lot of building going up within a few hundred metres of the hotel so if you are a light sleeper then maybe it is not for you. It is a very small hotel with only 20 rooms but that was a bonus because in the 11 nights I was there I only saw other guests 2 times and the hotel was full. The hotel is guest friendly and the elevator is the first thing that you see when you enter the hotel. It was no issue anyway as I was there with my Thai g/f. I will stay there again even though there is no pool or restaurant. The shower makes up for that, it is large and fits 2, lol.","CHADA THAI HOUSE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929814,100.882614&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929814,100.882614&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.931667,100.879440|12.930410,100.879868|12.931495,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.933609,100.881073|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774&signature=2l7JF5Dddwv1wJAR70388HHyMKg="

There is another big hotel along the alley and just outside are 2 7eleven around the corner. The hotel is quiet considering that it's located in Pattaya. You will not be able to hear loud music throughout the night once the doors are closed. Few minutes walk down one lane to the main beach and about 10 minutes walk to walking street.    Room was big and comfortable. Beds were soft and the whole place was very clean. The receptionist girls was very friendly and loan us her handphone when we wanted to call a local Thai friend. They were also very helpful in giving us directions and helping us out in anything we needed. For the price we paid, we were very satisfied. I would definitely stay here again.    The only 2 things was that the hotel will charge 3% for payment with credit card and there are lots of mosquitoes around, be sure to bring insect repellent.","CHADA THAI HOUSE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929814,100.882614&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929814,100.882614&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.931667,100.879440|12.930410,100.879868|12.931495,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.933609,100.881073|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774&signature=2l7JF5Dddwv1wJAR70388HHyMKg="

MissyLorna wrote a review Oct 2012,20,Nice hotel spoilt.,"We were confronted by the female Basil Faulty of Thailand! This woman has to be the worst front of house person we have ever met. It totally spoilt our stay. Having said that the room was nicely furnished and a very comfy bed. The internet was useless and the hotel is being misleading by advertising such. Do not leave your key with the reception as the office is unattended most of the time and the keys are left in full view. We found the night staff and the cleaner to be excellent, friendly and helpful. I would not recommend this place as there are far too many other hotels where you won't be made to feel unwelcome.","CHADA THAI HOUSE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929814,100.882614&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929814,100.882614&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.931667,100.879440|12.930410,100.879868|12.931495,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.933609,100.881073|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774&signature=2l7JF5Dddwv1wJAR70388HHyMKg="
Ryan's Real Deal wrote a review Sep 2012,50,Writing this from the hotel,"Lovely rooms, and they are nicer than the photos believe it or not, feels like a 4 star hotel, not 3!! Nice and quiet bathrooms are done to a high standard, do not hesitate coming here, 1 minute walk to second road, where u come out at beach roads soi 12, so very handy location too! For 28 Aussie dollars a night bargain!!    Free wifi in room which I'm on now,  Beds amazingly comfortable for a hotel!  LCD tv 32 inch    Will definately be returning","CHADA THAI HOUSE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929814,100.882614&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929814,100.882614&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.931667,100.879440|12.930410,100.879868|12.931495,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.933609,100.881073|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774&signature=2l7JF5Dddwv1wJAR70388HHyMKg="
Trexmid wrote a review Mar 2012,50,A Home from Home.,A quaint little place at the end of a dead end Soi. Nicely furnished modern rooms with beautiful linen and an oh so comfortable beds. The shower room is excellent and so are all the fixtures and fittings.  I would rate this as more of a couples hotels as opposed to one suited for a single guy out to enjoy the delights of Pattaya's hedonistic lifestyle with different partners.  The staff are excellent and could not do enough for me and were always asking me if there was anything more they could do to make my stay more enjoyable.,"CHADA THAI HOUSE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929814,100.882614&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929814,100.882614&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.931667,100.879440|12.930410,100.879868|12.931495,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.933609,100.881073|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774&signature=2l7JF5Dddwv1wJAR70388HHyMKg="
rishirchana wrote a review Dec 2011,50,Homely Aroma & Aura,"i was in pattaya in recent november 21, 2011 and after searching many hotels , i didnt found what i wanted like nice cool noise free place.    finally i found out that chada thai house maintained by well co-ordinated staff like real your house feelings.    Generally its a good budget hotel for single /double holders.    breakfast is good complementary everyday.    likewise walking distance near the central pattaya road & the most oustadings beach in the world.","CHADA THAI HOUSE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929814,100.882614&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929814,100.882614&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.931667,100.879440|12.930410,100.879868|12.931495,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.933609,100.881073|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774&signature=2l7JF5Dddwv1wJAR70388HHyMKg="
