Garry B wrote a review Mar 2020,30,Noisy area.,"Booked with Orbitz .com-- check in easy, room ready. We were on 2nd floor- 2 rooms. King bet, air, reasonable size, toilet good, tv, wi fi, balcony with no view. Overall room was good for price but at night noisy from activities in the soi. The swimming pool was great, Room servicing was good. Photos on internet are a little outdated. Room rate around 25 australian dollars per night. There are better rooms than the ones we had. Location is good for action seekers.","SUTUS COURT 2 - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928056,100.884865&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928056,100.884865&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.930957,100.887589|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294|12.929615,100.883430&signature=omaP7c10711Y66z-QQLFrp-RW9I="
hoges1959 wrote a review Dec 2019,20,Really disappointing,"The Sutus Court complex is in an excellent location if you like good cheap restaurants, plenty of places for a drink, easy access to transport and a short walk to the beach.  The check-in process was fine but that was about it. I was given a room on the 4th floor,which was fine to try and cut down on road noise, but no-one mentioned there's no elevator in that building,so me and the hotel employee had to carry the bags up several flights of stairs. We got to a room that was literally right under the roof.That is, the ceiling had a slope on it which meant things like using the mirror were impossible and it was a bit of a contortion to use the toilet.  The room itself had dated 70's decor, though the toilet had been replaced. There was no soap holder, the TV was new 20 years ago, the internet didn't work for a full day and neither did the phone when I rang up to ask about the internet! To cap it off,there were ants..... lots and lots of ants so putting rubbish into the smallest rubbish bin in Thailand was an excuse for the ants to come and visit.  I will use this complex again for all the reasons mentioned but will not use this hotel. It was a disappointing stay.","SUTUS COURT 2 - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928056,100.884865&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928056,100.884865&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.930957,100.887589|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294|12.929615,100.883430&signature=omaP7c10711Y66z-QQLFrp-RW9I="

Jim H wrote a review Sep 2016,40,On a budget - this could be the place,"This hotel offers customers a great choice from their larger roomed Sutus Court 1 to the lower priced but smaller units all located in adjacent buildings around the communal pool and car park.  This time, I stayed in Sutus Court 2 which is the second most expensive rooms they have available. Still good value though.  Approached through SC1 over a flat roof with pretty steep ramps which are very slippery when wet, pass the inviting jacuzzi and you are in your allocated room.  It does offer all the usual facilities but to be honest, they are tired and outdated and could do with replacement. That said, you get what you pay for and this option is both cheap and more than adequate for a few nights stay.    The Sutus Court buildings are well located on Buakhao with great restaurants on your doorstep. There is a decent sized car park although this can get full, pleasant enough staff except at night when they get out the grumpy versions and an acceptable coffee shop which all feature the statutory old experts on everything that is wrong with Thailand - You have met them!  All in all, this is a decent place to park your head during your trip to Pattaya.","SUTUS COURT 2 - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928056,100.884865&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928056,100.884865&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.930957,100.887589|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294|12.929615,100.883430&signature=omaP7c10711Y66z-QQLFrp-RW9I="

hoges1959 wrote a review Dec 2019,20,Really disappointing,"The Sutus Court complex is in an excellent location if you like good cheap restaurants, plenty of places for a drink, easy access to transport and a short walk to the beach.  The check-in process was fine but that was about it. I was given a room on the 4th floor,which was fine to try and cut down on road noise, but no-one mentioned there's no elevator in that building,so me and the hotel employee had to carry the bags up several flights of stairs. We got to a room that was literally right under the roof.That is, the ceiling had a slope on it which meant things like using the mirror were impossible and it was a bit of a contortion to use the toilet.  The room itself had dated 70's decor, though the toilet had been replaced. There was no soap holder, the TV was new 20 years ago, the internet didn't work for a full day and neither did the phone when I rang up to ask about the internet! To cap it off,there were ants..... lots and lots of ants so putting rubbish into the smallest rubbish bin in Thailand was an excuse for the ants to come and visit.  I will use this complex again for all the reasons mentioned but will not use this hotel. It was a disappointing stay.","SUTUS COURT 2 - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928056,100.884865&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928056,100.884865&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.930843,100.881950|12.929769,100.883492|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.930957,100.887589|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294|12.929615,100.883430&signature=O87mhCtHCZbXleKkKzPH7b4XOgE="

Jim H wrote a review Sep 2016,40,On a budget - this could be the place,"This hotel offers customers a great choice from their larger roomed Sutus Court 1 to the lower priced but smaller units all located in adjacent buildings around the communal pool and car park.  This time, I stayed in Sutus Court 2 which is the second most expensive rooms they have available. Still good value though.  Approached through SC1 over a flat roof with pretty steep ramps which are very slippery when wet, pass the inviting jacuzzi and you are in your allocated room.  It does offer all the usual facilities but to be honest, they are tired and outdated and could do with replacement. That said, you get what you pay for and this option is both cheap and more than adequate for a few nights stay.    The Sutus Court buildings are well located on Buakhao with great restaurants on your doorstep. There is a decent sized car park although this can get full, pleasant enough staff except at night when they get out the grumpy versions and an acceptable coffee shop which all feature the statutory old experts on everything that is wrong with Thailand - You have met them!  All in all, this is a decent place to park your head during your trip to Pattaya.","SUTUS COURT 2 - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928056,100.884865&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928056,100.884865&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.930843,100.881950|12.929769,100.883492|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.930957,100.887589|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294|12.929615,100.883430&signature=O87mhCtHCZbXleKkKzPH7b4XOgE="

hoges1959 wrote a review Dec 2019,20,Really disappointing,"The Sutus Court complex is in an excellent location if you like good cheap restaurants, plenty of places for a drink, easy access to transport and a short walk to the beach.  The check-in process was fine but that was about it. I was given a room on the 4th floor,which was fine to try and cut down on road noise, but no-one mentioned there's no elevator in that building,so me and the hotel employee had to carry the bags up several flights of stairs. We got to a room that was literally right under the roof.That is, the ceiling had a slope on it which meant things like using the mirror were impossible and it was a bit of a contortion to use the toilet.  The room itself had dated 70's decor, though the toilet had been replaced. There was no soap holder, the TV was new 20 years ago, the internet didn't work for a full day and neither did the phone when I rang up to ask about the internet! To cap it off,there were ants..... lots and lots of ants so putting rubbish into the smallest rubbish bin in Thailand was an excuse for the ants to come and visit.  I will use this complex again for all the reasons mentioned but will not use this hotel. It was a disappointing stay.","SUTUS COURT 2 - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928056,100.884865&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928056,100.884865&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.930843,100.881950|12.929769,100.883492|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.930957,100.887589|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294|12.929615,100.883430&signature=O87mhCtHCZbXleKkKzPH7b4XOgE="

Jim H wrote a review Sep 2016,40,On a budget - this could be the place,"This hotel offers customers a great choice from their larger roomed Sutus Court 1 to the lower priced but smaller units all located in adjacent buildings around the communal pool and car park.  This time, I stayed in Sutus Court 2 which is the second most expensive rooms they have available. Still good value though.  Approached through SC1 over a flat roof with pretty steep ramps which are very slippery when wet, pass the inviting jacuzzi and you are in your allocated room.  It does offer all the usual facilities but to be honest, they are tired and outdated and could do with replacement. That said, you get what you pay for and this option is both cheap and more than adequate for a few nights stay.    The Sutus Court buildings are well located on Buakhao with great restaurants on your doorstep. There is a decent sized car park although this can get full, pleasant enough staff except at night when they get out the grumpy versions and an acceptable coffee shop which all feature the statutory old experts on everything that is wrong with Thailand - You have met them!  All in all, this is a decent place to park your head during your trip to Pattaya.","SUTUS COURT 2 - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928056,100.884865&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928056,100.884865&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.930843,100.881950|12.929769,100.883492|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.930957,100.887589|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294|12.929615,100.883430&signature=O87mhCtHCZbXleKkKzPH7b4XOgE="

Dave the nomad wrote a review Jul 2016,40,Good central hotel,"I've stayed here several times in Sutus 1,2 and 5 all rooms were clean with good air con and fan , tv , free wifi and good bathrooms .  Although some of the rooms may not be the most modern I think that reflects on the price .  On first floor they have quite A big jacuzzi and on ground floor big pool both are well kept and clean .  I noticed during my stay the staff come out at about 5 am and everything is cleaned and brushed floors , chairs ,tables and pathways .......spotless  Also has ample free parking for residents which is good in that area !
