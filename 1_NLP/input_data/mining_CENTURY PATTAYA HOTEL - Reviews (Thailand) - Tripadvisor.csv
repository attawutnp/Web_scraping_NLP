Denise C wrote a review Jun 2019,30,Century Pattaya Hitel. Worth the stay.,"Away from the hectic and perhaps sleazy Bar area, the Century Pattaya Hotel is a quiet, pleasant place to stay. This hotel is a little old and has definitely seen better days. The rooms are larger than most and are serviced daily with clean linen and a good clean through of the room. I have stayed at more up market hotels in Pattaya and have not received service of this quality. I remember one more expensive hotel, we struggled to get our room made up at all.  Breakfast is automatically served as an ""American Breakfast"" it comes with weird little sausages and ham with eggs, I suggest you request the vegetarian option with noodles or fried rice, it's much nicer.  The swimming pool is due for restoration and has many lost broken tiles, currently it is swim at your own risk. We swam daily being very careful of the edges and bottom of the pool.  The staff are lovely and there are many pleasant restaurants and street stalls close by. Century is situated between 2 large shopping centres within walking distance. There are many dentists in the area and you can get early appointments without difficulty. I have used a couple of these facilities and been very happy with the service and the results. I highly recommend this hotel if you want am appropriate quiet place not next door to a bar but within walking distance if required.",CENTURY PATTAYA HOTEL - Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.933440,100.895813&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.933440,100.895813&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.933389,100.897560|12.933435,100.897408|12.934221,100.897774|12.933457,100.897423|12.934503,100.891907|12.932400,100.898849|12.932500,100.898972|12.934280,100.891502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.932719,100.898758|12.934425,100.893944|12.933379,100.898888|12.933244,100.896919|12.932694,100.896362|12.933247,100.898804|12.936825,100.893097|12.935522,100.896263|12.933944,100.899139&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.934105,100.897156|12.932687,100.895325|12.934375,100.897049|12.932275,100.892761|12.935860,100.893181|12.934711,100.892021|12.933580,100.897118|12.935577,100.896049|12.935827,100.898621&signature=L49gWcE5NdecU8laEyeiec-1A-k="

The room was very basic the TV has no reception no face towel just 2 very old towels.On our departure day we were accused of stealing their towels we told them to take a better look. Then they came back and said one of the towels was dirty ( it had a a bit of makeup on it) and was told to pay 300B. How absurd arent towels suppose to get dirty , isnt it their job to wash towels?

frevv wrote a review Jan 2011,10,Worst hotel ever,"Went there in a tour this month, my advice stay away from this hotel. Service was terrible. I went there in a group tour, as we are checking out, one of the staff was checking the rooms, then came back and said that there was a towel missing from a room, so they were asking for payment for the towel, I asked the people in the bus whether anyone's probably took the towel and left it in other room, one girl said that she took a towel from her room and left it in her mum's room so I told that to the staff, and asked them to checked the mum's room. Sure enough, they already know that there were 3 towels in the other room. Not getting money from that scenario, they again told me to pay up because one of the towel was real dirty. So I asked them what's the problem with that, aren't they going to wash the towels anyway? why should i pay for the dirty towel? They say it's real dirty and damaged, so I told them I want to see it, they bring it down to me, and there was only this one dark spot (make-up spot). So I told them that it was only make-up spot, which will be gone once it's being washed, but they still insist that I pay 300baht for it. Oh even my tour guide was telling us when we check in to make sure that the Tv's working, all appliances are in good working condition, check that there are 2 towels in the room and nothing in the room's broken..    My advice, stay away from this hotel, the cheap price's not worth all the trouble.",CENTURY PATTAYA HOTEL - Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.933440,100.895813&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.933440,100.895813&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.933389,100.897560|12.933435,100.897408|12.934221,100.897774|12.933457,100.897423|12.934503,100.891907|12.932400,100.898849|12.932500,100.898972|12.934280,100.891502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.932719,100.898758|12.934425,100.893944|12.933379,100.898888|12.933244,100.896919|12.932694,100.896362|12.933247,100.898804|12.936825,100.893097|12.935522,100.896263|12.933944,100.899139&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.934105,100.897156|12.932687,100.895325|12.934375,100.897049|12.932275,100.892761|12.935860,100.893181|12.934711,100.892021|12.933580,100.897118|12.935577,100.896049|12.935827,100.898621&signature=L49gWcE5NdecU8laEyeiec-1A-k="

Mapoo wrote a review Oct 2009,30,"Great Hotel, but not ""DISABLED FRIENDLY""","Walking in the Hotel there is a Wheelchair Ramp, what is Great. The place has Lifts what is Excellent. But the thing is, We was Located on the 7th Floor, there is 8 floors to the Building. But we took my Grandmother to Pattaya and she has had a Stroke and not good on feet, shes 80 years old, now being located on the 7th floor is not good as if there was a Fire, there is no good Escape for her! and also if the Lift was Broken she couldn't manage the Stairs. Shower dosnt have enough Grab Handles. The Shower is Rubbish its one that is on the Taps. lol. But you have to make do.    The Hotel was great, the Food wasnt good for English! If you want a nice Breakfast go to ""Robins Nest-urant"" its not too far about 10-15 minutes"" Tuk-Tuk can drop you off there within about 5 minutes. Its very Central near all Shops. Quite far from Walking Street though.    Overall the Hotel is Very clean. Basic room and Air Condition wasnt the Best! but best thing to do is Leave it on all the time while out (But some Cleaners turn it off) then you end up Walking into a Sauna Room lol. So Leave on your Air Con & Hope they don't turn it off. Swimming Pool is Great and Big. Beach is down the Road, 10-15 minute walk.    Our main concern was, No good for Disabled people.

rodmail1 wrote a review Apr 2005,20,Sort of thumbs down,"The price is good at this place, but there are downsides.    They are not well located. A newcomer only figures out the bahtbus late in the visit and bahtbusses that go the length of pattaya are on beach and 2nd road. Both of those are some significant walking distance away on very poor and uneven sidewalks so you have to do some walking every single time you want to get anywhere at all and the sidewalks generate twisted ankles.    The breakfast buffet is good and included in the price. The staff is good and they care, but when any sort of question arises at the front desk the more senior and experienced people there are referred to and they always choose to gouge in price for something, anything. They arranged a taxi for me back to the airport and priced it at 1200 baht, which was fair. On the morning of departure, however, they informed me that price did not include tolls on the highway and to include them would be another 300 baht. I added the tolls up enroute and they were 120.    I know it's a poor country, but there's no call for this. If they need more money just price it that way.    Mixed experience overall. If you are a veteran of pattaya and are comfortable on the dangerous motorbike taxis the location issue goes away and all will probably be well.    Oh, one more thing. They gave me a room with a weak air con. It just wasn't cooling the room well. I complained and was moved, but they didn't believe me about the air con. The 2nd room was better. I later saw staff with freon testing gizmos in the elevator so they do clearly have an ongoing activity dealing with their air con. OTOH, they have the staff with the equipment trying to address the problem.    So there it is. If you are a veteran of Pattaya the price here is excellent value, given their excellent breakfast. If you are new, I would recommend somewhere else, closer to the beach road and farther towards Jomtien.",CENTURY PATTAYA HOTEL - Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.933440,100.895813&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.933440,100.895813&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.933389,100.897560|12.933435,100.897408|12.934221,100.897774|12.933457,100.897423|12.934503,100.891907|12.932400,100.898849|12.932500,100.898972|12.934280,100.891502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.932719,100.898758|12.934425,100.893944|12.933379,100.898888|12.933244,100.896919|12.932694,100.896362|12.933247,100.898804|12.936825,100.893097|12.935522,100.896263|12.933944,100.899139&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.934105,100.897156|12.932687,100.895325|12.934375,100.897049|12.932275,100.892761|12.935860,100.893181|12.934711,100.892021|12.933580,100.897118|12.935577,100.896049|12.935827,100.898621&signature=L49gWcE5NdecU8laEyeiec-1A-k="
