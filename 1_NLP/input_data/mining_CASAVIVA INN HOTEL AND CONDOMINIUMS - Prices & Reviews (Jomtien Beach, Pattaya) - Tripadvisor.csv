Eddie W wrote a review Dec 2013,40,A Pleasent Place To Stay,"The proprietors are a lovely helpful couple, they know everything you need to know about where to go and what there is to do. It's very handy for the beach and they supply you with beach towels. Everything you need like chemist, super market etc is on the door step. The rates are very reasonable and speaking to others that where staying at the Casa Viva say they've stayed before and they'll be staying again. If we are lucky enough to get back to Thailand we would stay there again.

Very nice rooms to a good standard and the area is very quite. Walk to the end of the soi and you can walk either way along 8 km of sandy beach. Plenty of places to eat and lots of 7/11's along the way. If you want the madness of Pattaya it's a €0.30 20 minute ride. They also run 24/7 and are safe to travel on.

Angela194z wrote a review Apr 2010,50,Clean & large rooms,"My family have just arrived back from an unexpected stay at the Casaviva Inn hotel. We were delayed because of the Volcanic Ash problem which delayed our return to the UK. We arrived at Pattaya bus station and ask the taxi driver to take us to somewhere clean, cheap and quiet. He did just that. We arrived and was given a large room 302 on the third floor. There was myself, my husband and my 8 year old son. We were impressed with the cleanliness and size of the room. The hotel also has free internet access. You can also use the computer in reception free of charge. The hotel is also very close to Jomtien beach. The husband and wife team are very helpful especially in answering questions on places of interests and costs of trips etc. The only thing I would add to the rooms is a small table and chairs. Otherwise the room is very adaquate. There is no swimming pool but I took my son to the Saritta hotel which is opposite and if you buy a drink they don't mind you using the pool. There are also a Family Mart close by and a laundry service next door.","CASAVIVA INN HOTEL AND CONDOMINIUMS - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882465,100.882278&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882465,100.882278&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950|12.884031,100.883522&signature=LI2wM3G8XFWq-KXJKJJcEQMycW8="

Very nice rooms to a good standard and the area is very quite. Walk to the end of the soi and you can walk either way along 8 km of sandy beach. Plenty of places to eat and lots of 7/11's along the way. If you want the madness of Pattaya it's a €0.30 20 minute ride. They also run 24/7 and are safe to travel on. Will come back here again without doubt real value for money and the A/C is first class.","CASAVIVA INN HOTEL AND CONDOMINIUMS - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882465,100.882278&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882465,100.882278&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950|12.884031,100.883522&signature=LI2wM3G8XFWq-KXJKJJcEQMycW8="

Angela194z wrote a review Apr 2010,50,Clean & large rooms,"My family have just arrived back from an unexpected stay at the Casaviva Inn hotel. We were delayed because of the Volcanic Ash problem which delayed our return to the UK. We arrived at Pattaya bus station and ask the taxi driver to take us to somewhere clean, cheap and quiet. He did just that. We arrived and was given a large room 302 on the third floor. There was myself, my husband and my 8 year old son. We were impressed with the cleanliness and size of the room. The hotel also has free internet access. You can also use the computer in reception free of charge. The hotel is also very close to Jomtien beach. The husband and wife team are very helpful especially in answering questions on places of interests and costs of trips etc. The only thing I would add to the rooms is a small table and chairs. Otherwise the room is very adaquate. There is no swimming pool but I took my son to the Saritta hotel which is opposite and if you buy a drink they don't mind you using the pool. There are also a Family Mart close by and a laundry service next door.","CASAVIVA INN HOTEL AND CONDOMINIUMS - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882465,100.882278&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882465,100.882278&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950|12.884031,100.883522&signature=LI2wM3G8XFWq-KXJKJJcEQMycW8="

Eddie W wrote a review Dec 2013,40,A Pleasent Place To Stay,"The proprietors are a lovely helpful couple, they know everything you need to know about where to go and what there is to do. It's very handy for the beach and they supply you with beach towels. Everything you need like chemist, super market etc is on the door step. The rates are very reasonable and speaking to others that where staying at the Casa Viva say they've stayed before and they'll be staying again. If we are lucky enough to get back to Thailand we would stay there again.

Very nice rooms to a good standard and the area is very quite. Walk to the end of the soi and you can walk either way along 8 km of sandy beach. Plenty of places to eat and lots of 7/11's along the way. If you want the madness of Pattaya it's a €0.30 20 minute ride. They also run 24/7 and are safe to travel on.

We were delayed because of the Volcanic Ash problem which delayed our return to the UK. We arrived at Pattaya bus station and ask the taxi driver to take us to somewhere clean, cheap and quiet. He did just that. We arrived and was given a large room 302 on the third floor. There was myself, my husband and my 8 year old son. We were impressed with the cleanliness and size of the room. The hotel also has free internet access. You can also use the computer in reception free of charge. The hotel is also very close to Jomtien beach. The husband and wife team are very helpful especially in answering questions on places of interests and costs of trips etc. The only thing I would add to the rooms is a small table and chairs. Otherwise the room is very adaquate. There is no swimming pool but I took my son to the Saritta hotel which is opposite and if you buy a drink they don't mind you using the pool.

For the rates this hotel represent exelent value and we will stay there again.","CASAVIVA INN HOTEL AND CONDOMINIUMS - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.882465,100.882278&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.882465,100.882278&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950|12.884031,100.883522&signature=LI2wM3G8XFWq-KXJKJJcEQMycW8="
