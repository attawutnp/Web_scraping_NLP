Veni Vidi wrote a review Dec 2018,50,This could be paradise...,"I was looking for a quiet place to rest during my last days in Thailand. Regarding the pictures and reviews I booked this new hostel : it was definitely the right choice.  I had a double room with balcony and shared bathroom on the same level (man and ladies separated, and enough showers and toilets, no need to wait). And so clean !!  This place is so nice for groups, families or solo travelers.  It is just 2 walking minutes from the beach, market, shops, restaurants and even transport to Pattaya city.  You can lay or sit down in the garden and listen to relax music.  Staff is so friendly and helpful and during the night there are guardians so you feel secure.    Would definitely stay here again!!

KCuong Bui wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Cute hotel & excellent service,"The hotel is very unquie compared to others nearby. Only 9 rooms with 1 very small restaurant, 1 kitchen with complimentary drinking water. We had 2 pleasure days staying here.    The hotel is really near many attractions like Jomtien beach, Jomtien night market, massgae and restaurant. You also can easily catch a song theo taxi from Jomtien road. Hotel also can help you book tour to Coral/ Koh Larn island.    The boss & staffs are really helful & friendly. The atmosphere is so peaceful and quite.I am so happy during the time I & my friend were there.

Regarding the pictures and reviews I booked this new hostel : it was definitely the right choice.  I had a double room with balcony and shared bathroom on the same level (man and ladies separated, and enough showers and toilets, no need to wait). And so clean !!  This place is so nice for groups, families or solo travelers.  It is just 2 walking minutes from the beach, market, shops, restaurants and even transport to Pattaya city.  You can lay or sit down in the garden and listen to relax music.  Staff is so friendly and helpful and during the night there are guardians so you feel secure.    Would definitely stay here again!!

Hotel also can help you book tour to Coral/ Koh Larn island.    The boss & staffs are really helful & friendly.

Veni Vidi wrote a review Dec 2018,50,This could be paradise...,"I was looking for a quiet place to rest during my last days in Thailand. Regarding the pictures and reviews I booked this new hostel : it was definitely the right choice.  I had a double room with balcony and shared bathroom on the same level (man and ladies separated, and enough showers and toilets, no need to wait). And so clean !!  This place is so nice for groups, families or solo travelers.  It is just 2 walking minutes from the beach, market, shops, restaurants and even transport to Pattaya city.  You can lay or sit down in the garden and listen to relax music.  Staff is so friendly and helpful and during the night there are guardians so you feel secure.    Would definitely stay here again!!  Thank you 🙏","JN9 POSHTEL - Prices & Inn Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.891460,100.876312&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.891460,100.876312|12.891460,100.876312&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.891585,100.874062|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.890499,100.879494|12.893726,100.876503|12.892040,100.873306|12.894398,100.874542|12.888050,100.876839|12.888939,100.877937|12.888940,100.877953|12.894320,100.874474&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.892222,100.876945|12.891152,100.875732|12.893725,100.873589|12.890544,100.875351|12.894294,100.874367|12.890622,100.875580|12.890904,100.874466|12.894552,100.874634&signature=CizJPqsnZDtP36roLG2pblxpJdk="

Hotel also can help you book tour to Coral/ Koh Larn island.    The boss & staffs are really helful & friendly.
