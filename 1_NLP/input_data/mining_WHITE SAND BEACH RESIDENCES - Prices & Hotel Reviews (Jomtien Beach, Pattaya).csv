Nararat B wrote a review Jul 2020,40,Amazing panoramic sea view,"One of the best residence to stay when visiting Pattaya.  I stay at one bedroom suite, room is spacious(1 br + 1 LV room). Bathroom has perfect sea view, separate bathtub and shower. Pantry in living room has big refrigerator, microwave, electric stove, hot pot and kitchenware.  The best thing in this room is the panoramic sea view!! You can enjoy the amazing view all day long by your private balcony. Residence has a big pool and few step to the beach.  Staffs are friendly only not feel like hotel atmosphere but it is ok.  PS. Only this period, residence does not provide food and beverages so you have to arrange by your own.","WHITE SAND BEACH RESIDENCES - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.832567,100.909157&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.832567,100.909157|12.832567,100.909157&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.839743,100.912704&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.835727,100.912987|12.833741,100.908241|12.829955,100.912567|12.833126,100.909164|12.824270,100.911591|12.841268,100.910469|12.840440,100.911743|12.836864,100.912529|12.831965,100.914322&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.833395,100.909111|12.831585,100.909805|12.830833,100.909698|12.827933,100.910110|12.838456,100.908867|12.834017,100.910080|12.839891,100.906013|12.841706,100.910835&signature=Sa1RUecn8JNXo8EOu6ShpHSj3Ug="

We tried it 3 times after 09am, the choice wasn’t big and many things already missing, but the most disgusting were the fly’s on the vegetables which looked not very fresh at this early time on all the 3 days, so we preferred to go to a 7elewen.    good to know:  There is no convenience store in the property or nearby, you should have a car to go shopping or dining outside. There is a coffee machine in the kitchen (N espresso), but no pads provided and nowhere to buy.","WHITE SAND BEACH RESIDENCES - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.832567,100.909157&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.832567,100.909157|12.832567,100.909157&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.839743,100.912704&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.835727,100.912987|12.833741,100.908241|12.829955,100.912567|12.833126,100.909164|12.824270,100.911591|12.841268,100.910469|12.840440,100.911743|12.836864,100.912529|12.831965,100.914322&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.833395,100.909111|12.831585,100.909805|12.830833,100.909698|12.827933,100.910110|12.838456,100.908867|12.834017,100.910080|12.839891,100.906013|12.841706,100.910835&signature=Sa1RUecn8JNXo8EOu6ShpHSj3Ug="

NoekeD wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Absolutely great,"Stayed there with my husband, son and parents in a executive 2 bedroom appartment. It was spacious, clean and convenient. The balconies are decent of size and the view is magnificent. The pool is great! And love that they have a private beach.    The aircon was noisy and the room service took ages to get us 2 pizza's. So there is room to improve there, but that is not stopping me to go back. We already reserved a 1 month stay in April. I will be reviewing again after our stay.","WHITE SAND BEACH RESIDENCES - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.832567,100.909157&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.832567,100.909157|12.832567,100.909157&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.839743,100.912704&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.835727,100.912987|12.833741,100.908241|12.829955,100.912567|12.833126,100.909164|12.824270,100.911591|12.841268,100.910469|12.840440,100.911743|12.836864,100.912529|12.831965,100.914322&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.833395,100.909111|12.831585,100.909805|12.830833,100.909698|12.827933,100.910110|12.838456,100.908867|12.834017,100.910080|12.839891,100.906013|12.841706,100.910835&signature=Sa1RUecn8JNXo8EOu6ShpHSj3Ug="

Nararat B wrote a review Jul 2020,40,Amazing panoramic sea view,"One of the best residence to stay when visiting Pattaya.  I stay at one bedroom suite, room is spacious(1 br + 1 LV room). Bathroom has perfect sea view, separate bathtub and shower. Pantry in living room has big refrigerator, microwave, electric stove, hot pot and kitchenware.  The best thing in this room is the panoramic sea view!! You can enjoy the amazing view all day long by your private balcony. Residence has a big pool and few step to the beach.  Staffs are friendly only not feel like hotel atmosphere but it is ok.  PS. Only this period, residence does not provide food and beverages so you have to arrange by your own.","WHITE SAND BEACH RESIDENCES - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.832567,100.909157&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.832567,100.909157|12.832567,100.909157&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.839743,100.912704&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.835727,100.912987|12.833741,100.908241|12.829955,100.912567|12.833126,100.909164|12.824270,100.911591|12.841268,100.910469|12.840440,100.911743|12.836864,100.912529|12.831965,100.914322&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.833395,100.909111|12.831585,100.909805|12.830833,100.909698|12.827933,100.910110|12.838456,100.908867|12.834017,100.910080|12.839891,100.906013|12.841706,100.910835&signature=Sa1RUecn8JNXo8EOu6ShpHSj3Ug="

We tried it 3 times after 09am, the choice wasn’t big and many things already missing, but the most disgusting were the fly’s on the vegetables which looked not very fresh at this early time on all the 3 days, so we preferred to go to a 7elewen.    good to know:  There is no convenience store in the property or nearby, you should have a car to go shopping or dining outside. There is a coffee machine in the kitchen (N espresso), but no pads provided and nowhere to buy.","WHITE SAND BEACH RESIDENCES - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.832567,100.909157&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.832567,100.909157|12.832567,100.909157&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.839743,100.912704&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.835727,100.912987|12.833741,100.908241|12.829955,100.912567|12.833126,100.909164|12.824270,100.911591|12.841268,100.910469|12.840440,100.911743|12.836864,100.912529|12.831965,100.914322&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.833395,100.909111|12.831585,100.909805|12.830833,100.909698|12.827933,100.910110|12.838456,100.908867|12.834017,100.910080|12.839891,100.906013|12.841706,100.910835&signature=Sa1RUecn8JNXo8EOu6ShpHSj3Ug="

NoekeD wrote a review Mar 2018,50,Absolutely great,"Stayed there with my husband, son and parents in a executive 2 bedroom appartment. It was spacious, clean and convenient. The balconies are decent of size and the view is magnificent. The pool is great! And love that they have a private beach.    The aircon was noisy and the room service took ages to get us 2 pizza's. So there is room to improve there, but that is not stopping me to go back. We already reserved a 1 month stay in April. I will be reviewing again after our stay.","WHITE SAND BEACH RESIDENCES - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.832567,100.909157&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.832567,100.909157|12.832567,100.909157&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.839743,100.912704&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.835727,100.912987|12.833741,100.908241|12.829955,100.912567|12.833126,100.909164|12.824270,100.911591|12.841268,100.910469|12.840440,100.911743|12.836864,100.912529|12.831965,100.914322&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.833395,100.909111|12.831585,100.909805|12.830833,100.909698|12.827933,100.910110|12.838456,100.908867|12.834017,100.910080|12.839891,100.906013|12.841706,100.910835&signature=Sa1RUecn8JNXo8EOu6ShpHSj3Ug="

Room Service food was delicious with reasonable price. The pool was nice a quite. We enjoyed the walk on the beach to the Marina. It's the best location in Pattaya for us.

We tried it 3 times after 09am, the choice wasn’t big and many things already missing, but the most disgusting were the fly’s on the vegetables which looked not very fresh at this early time on all the 3 days, so we preferred to go to a 7elewen.    good to know:  There is no convenience store in the property or nearby, you should have a car to go shopping or dining outside. There is a coffee machine in the kitchen (N espresso), but no pads provided and nowhere to buy.","WHITE SAND BEACH RESIDENCES - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.832567,100.909157&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.832567,100.909157|12.832567,100.909157&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.839743,100.912704&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.835727,100.912987|12.833741,100.908241|12.829955,100.912567|12.833126,100.909164|12.824270,100.911591|12.841268,100.910469|12.840440,100.911743|12.836864,100.912529|12.831965,100.914322&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.833395,100.909111|12.831585,100.909805|12.830833,100.909698|12.827933,100.910110|12.838456,100.908867|12.834017,100.910080|12.839891,100.906013|12.841706,100.910835&signature=Sa1RUecn8JNXo8EOu6ShpHSj3Ug="
