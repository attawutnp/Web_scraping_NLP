Edwin G wrote a review Sep 2018,50,"Nice convenient condominium building, quiet, with good facilities.","The Cliff is an up-market condominium development constructed and completed by the distinguished Nova Group at the end of 2014, situated off Soi Kanchana 3, in the prestigious Cosy Beach area of Pratumnak and only 300 metres from the beach. Cosy Beach is well-known for its seclusion, being cut-off from Pattaya Bay and Jomtien Beach and hence avoiding the Jet-ski operators and beach vendors.    The Cliff is however, located close to number of 5-star hotels such as the Royal Cliff and Sheraton and is within easy walking distance of popular upscale restaurants such as “The Sky Gallery” and ‘The Chocolate Factory” together with a large amount of convenience stores, curio shops, pharmacies, massage parlors, bars and the prestigious Royal Veruna Yacht Club. If this wasn’t impressive enough, there is also a nearby public park and jogging track for those wishing to exercise and keep fit. Similarly Walking Street, Jomtien Beach and central Pattaya are less than a 5 minute drive away.    With its 427 units on 27 floors, The Cliff affords breathtaking panoramic views overlooking Pattaya Bay, Koh Larn and Buddha Hill depending upon your choice of unit. Furthermore the project is located on a massive 5912 Square Meter or 3.70 Rai plot of land, of which 50% is dedicated to green areas with lush lawns and tropical landscaping.    The Developer, namely the Nova Group Co.,Ltd first began its life as far back as 1994 with the construction of hotels and serviced apartments, such as “Nova Park”. Encouraged by this success and under the inspired leadership of Rony Fineman, often referred to as ‘the man who built Pattaya’, Nova Group soon branched out into building condominiums, with the first being “Nova Mirage” in 2004. They soon became a household name in Pattaya and as a trusted and respected developer. To date, Nova Group have built numerous successful projects such as “Serenity Wong Amat”, “The Palm”, “Avenue Residences”, “Nova Ocean View”, “Nova Atrium”, “Novana Residences” and more recently “Amari Residences” whilst construction of “The Orient” is presently underway in joint collaboration with Matrix Developments Co.,Ltd.    ▶ Key communal facilities at The Cliff Residence Pattaya:  Spectacular 2-story high, hotel-like lobby and reception area.  A stunning pool with a decorative artificial rock formation waterfall, jacuzzi zone and waterslide.  A dedicated children’s pool and play area with jungle gym and swings.  A fully-equipped and air-conditioned fitness centre with same sex changing rooms, showers and saunas.  Pool sun deck and seating areas.  Professional on-site juristic management service.  On-site property management and laundry service for an added fee.  A mixture of open-air and covered underground car-parking spaces.  On-site commercial shop units on the street facing side of the project alongside Soi Kasetsin 2.  3 High speed passenger lifts and 1 goods/service lift.  24-Hour security with key-card access and CCTV cameras.    ▶ Proximity to attractions in Pattaya and beyond:  Seven-Eleven & Family Mart convenience stores: 1-Minute (Walking)  Non-regulated Baht Bus and Motor-bike Taxi stands: 2-Minutes (Walking).

Joana S wrote a review Jun 2018,10,A huge scam,"Not acceptable. We arrived at the condo after a huge trip (the distances were completely different from the ones at the reservation website - the whole description was a lie). When we arrived they had a huge sign saying “we are not a hotel” and knew nothing about our reservation. We called the number on the reservation confirmation and a person picks up and also knew nothing about our reservation. He then told us to go get the key at a mailbox. He was not there to receive us our to get the money. When we get to the room it was discusting, super dirty and full of hair and food leftovers. It had old food inside the fridge. It has a pair of shoes and a pair of underwear at the balcony. It felt like it was the home of somebody where we had to spend the night.

PattayaVagabond wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Great Location Great Swimming Pool,"The Cliff Condo has a great location between Pattaya and Jomtien. It's located in the Cosy Beach area. It's a 5 minute walk to the beach from the condo. The swimming pool is very large. Great for lap swimmers. You don't see many pools this big in the Pattaya area. However, you should be aware the Cliff does not want short-term renters. They require renters to sign a 30-day lease. Otherwise, renters are violating the Hotel Act of Thailand. The Cliff has posted a warning of 10,000 baht fines if renting under 30 days.

M S wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Vacation Rental and Dental Treatment.,"The Cliff Residence Condo    Pattaya    Great Vacation and Dental Treatment    510850758    Since years I stayed in Pattaya for 2 to 3 month during the summer and rented an apartment. One of the newest apartment buildings is The Cliff. This 27 story building is located 4 blocks of the Gulf of Thailand and beach. The building is well secured, has an elegant lobby, Olympic size pool, children's pool, whirl pool, state of the art exercise room. Apartments can be rented for a minimum of 3 days starting at 1000 Baht per day for a studio, one and two bed rooms are also available. The in-house renting and selling agent is Property Studio Com. LTD. Talk to Nui she is very accommodating and helpful, tell her Manfred send you. This company also provide cleaning and laundry service, taxi, rental car and motor bike service.  The high sea-side floors have a great view of the Gulf of Thailand and the many islands in the background every apartment has a balcony. I rented apartments in this building for the last 3 years and found the best equipped apartment is 2214 with a 55' flat screen smart TV with soundbar, DVD and CD player, floor to ceiling windows and doors, a large wash machine and all the pots and pants. The apartment has a king size bed and a sleeper for two.The building is located in the hills outside of Pattaya, with no public transportation, a taxi ride to town is about $4, I rented motor scooter 2500 Baht a month to be mobile.  If you need dental work the Pattaya International Dental Center is a modern and very professional dental practice. During the years my treatments included 5 implants, 2 crowns, 1 root canal and never had a problem. make an appointment with Dr. Narin tell him Manfred send you.  You can reach Pattaya from the Bangkok Airport by bus that will take you to Jomtien, from here you can take a taxi to reach your hotel. I made a reservation with limousine service in Thailand they will meet you at the airport, the price is 1500 Baht for the approximately 90 min ride in a new and comfortable Toyota Camry, a real bargain.  When I arrive in Thailand first I make a hotel reservation for 2 days, since most flights are overnight. I sleep one day and make my apartment rental arrangement the next day, hotels in walking distance are Cosy Beach hotel, or Royal Cliff Beach and Royal Cliff Grande. The exchange rate in the summer of 2017 was $1=33.5 baht.","THE CLIFF RESIDENCE CONDO - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.920938,100.862602&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.920938,100.862602&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.928483,100.862694|12.924710,100.867577|12.920770,100.866524|12.923032,100.868019|12.925503,100.871490|12.925854,100.871498|12.921944,100.866280|12.925252,100.870277&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923379,100.859665|12.923672,100.873116|12.911025,100.860687|12.922490,100.859955|12.924771,100.860611|12.910872,100.861397|12.923467,100.859528|12.926645,100.861610|12.926686,100.861847&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.922674,100.859497|12.924386,100.859207|12.923552,100.859947|12.923232,100.859421|12.925546,100.861938|12.913719,100.867088|12.923741,100.869438|12.921500,100.859299|12.922292,100.863571&signature=THLpU00kvbc9VjVc43wv9pbGrIM="

John N wrote a review Oct 2016,40,The Best Place To Stay In Pattaya,"In my opinion Cosy Beach is the best place to stay in Pattaya. Nice quiet area that is only a 10 minute taxi ride to the hustle and bustle of Walking Street.  Our one bedroom apartment at The Cliff Residence Condo had a small kitchen and lounge room, a nice modern bathroom and bedroom with king size bed.  The view was great from our balcony and we were about 10 minutes walk to the beach with some nice little restaurants along the way.  We had two issues that were a little annoying. Firstly, the pool slide wasn't working and looked like it hadn't worked for a while. Not a big issue but we did pick this hotel because of the pool as the grandson was coming over to stay once or twice.  Secondly, we arrived expecting to pay cash for our stay as this is a condo, not a hotel. But we arrived on a Sunday and there were no staff around. So, the security guard gave us our room key and had no further information for us. It took 3 days to work out how and where to pay. No staff we spoke to knew anything about accepting payment. If it had taken 6 days to work it out we would have been on our way home, money intact.","THE CLIFF RESIDENCE CONDO - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.920938,100.862602&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.920938,100.862602&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.928483,100.862694|12.924710,100.867577|12.920770,100.866524|12.923032,100.868019|12.925503,100.871490|12.925854,100.871498|12.921944,100.866280|12.925252,100.870277&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923379,100.859665|12.923672,100.873116|12.911025,100.860687|12.922490,100.859955|12.924771,100.860611|12.910872,100.861397|12.923467,100.859528|12.926645,100.861610|12.926686,100.861847&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.922674,100.859497|12.924386,100.859207|12.923552,100.859947|12.923232,100.859421|12.925546,100.861938|12.913719,100.867088|12.923741,100.869438|12.921500,100.859299|12.922292,100.863571&signature=THLpU00kvbc9VjVc43wv9pbGrIM="

They have 6 sizes of rooms, 38,48,72,74,91,102sq.m~  Very nice 46m. long pool, with fun slider, saunas gym.  Location is very nice and close to the beach but not for public transport, though there are many motorbike, and car taxies waiting downstairs, plenty of small shops and restaurants, some new very posh places wits perfect sea views.  If you are renting, using various sites to book, prices can vary dramatically.  Overall very nice place to live and to enjoy holiday or long term living.

Morten M wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Amazing,"This building is located right outside the hustle and bustle of Pattaya C.  It's 300 meter from one of the better beaches of Pattaya called Cosy Beach. But it's the pool area that really impressed me. - It's very beautiful and right next to the pool there is a well equipped gym.  The building is high end and everything is well maintained. The Wifi is the fastest I have tried in Thailand. The reception is open from 9 AM - 6 PM.  The area is quiet and a lot greener then the rest of Pattaya Central. But You are still very close to everything.  Walking Street, which is the nightlife center of Pattaya starts only 1,3 km away next to the Bali Hai Pier. This place is also where you drive fast go-cards and catch a cheap 30 min. ferry to the nearby island of Koh Lan. My warmest recommendations for this place. I really enjoyed it.","THE CLIFF RESIDENCE CONDO - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.920938,100.862602&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.920938,100.862602&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.928483,100.862694|12.924710,100.867577|12.920770,100.866524|12.923032,100.868019|12.925503,100.871490|12.925854,100.871498|12.921944,100.866280|12.925252,100.870277&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923379,100.859665|12.923672,100.873116|12.911025,100.860687|12.922490,100.859955|12.924771,100.860611|12.910872,100.861397|12.923467,100.859528|12.926645,100.861610|12.926686,100.861847&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.922674,100.859497|12.924386,100.859207|12.923552,100.859947|12.923232,100.859421|12.925546,100.861938|12.913719,100.867088|12.923741,100.869438|12.921500,100.859299|12.922292,100.863571&signature=THLpU00kvbc9VjVc43wv9pbGrIM="

Edwin G wrote a review Sep 2018,50,"Nice convenient condominium building, quiet, with good facilities.","The Cliff is an up-market condominium development constructed and completed by the distinguished Nova Group at the end of 2014, situated off Soi Kanchana 3, in the prestigious Cosy Beach area of Pratumnak and only 300 metres from the beach. Cosy Beach is well-known for its seclusion, being cut-off from Pattaya Bay and Jomtien Beach and hence avoiding the Jet-ski operators and beach vendors.    The Cliff is however, located close to number of 5-star hotels such as the Royal Cliff and Sheraton and is within easy walking distance of popular upscale restaurants such as “The Sky Gallery” and ‘The Chocolate Factory” together with a large amount of convenience stores, curio shops, pharmacies, massage parlors, bars and the prestigious Royal Veruna Yacht Club. If this wasn’t impressive enough, there is also a nearby public park and jogging track for those wishing to exercise and keep fit. Similarly Walking Street, Jomtien Beach and central Pattaya are less than a 5 minute drive away.    With its 427 units on 27 floors, The Cliff affords breathtaking panoramic views overlooking Pattaya Bay, Koh Larn and Buddha Hill depending upon your choice of unit. Furthermore the project is located on a massive 5912 Square Meter or 3.70 Rai plot of land, of which 50% is dedicated to green areas with lush lawns and tropical landscaping.    The Developer, namely the Nova Group Co.,Ltd first began its life as far back as 1994 with the construction of hotels and serviced apartments, such as “Nova Park”.

Joana S wrote a review Jun 2018,10,A huge scam,"Not acceptable. We arrived at the condo after a huge trip (the distances were completely different from the ones at the reservation website - the whole description was a lie). When we arrived they had a huge sign saying “we are not a hotel” and knew nothing about our reservation. We called the number on the reservation confirmation and a person picks up and also knew nothing about our reservation. He then told us to go get the key at a mailbox. He was not there to receive us our to get the money. When we get to the room it was discusting, super dirty and full of hair and food leftovers. It had old food inside the fridge. It has a pair of shoes and a pair of underwear at the balcony. It felt like it was the home of somebody where we had to spend the night. IT WAS NOT OKAY, so I left and did not pay.","THE CLIFF RESIDENCE CONDO - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.920938,100.862602&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.920938,100.862602&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.928483,100.862694|12.924710,100.867577|12.920770,100.866524|12.923032,100.868019|12.925503,100.871490|12.925854,100.871498|12.921944,100.866280|12.925252,100.870277&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923379,100.859665|12.923672,100.873116|12.911025,100.860687|12.922490,100.859955|12.924771,100.860611|12.910872,100.861397|12.923467,100.859528|12.926645,100.861610|12.926686,100.861847&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.922674,100.859497|12.924386,100.859207|12.923552,100.859947|12.923232,100.859421|12.925546,100.861938|12.913719,100.867088|12.923741,100.869438|12.921500,100.859299|12.922292,100.863571&signature=THLpU00kvbc9VjVc43wv9pbGrIM="
PattayaVagabond wrote a review Apr 2018,50,Great Location Great Swimming Pool,"The Cliff Condo has a great location between Pattaya and Jomtien. It's located in the Cosy Beach area. It's a 5 minute walk to the beach from the condo. The swimming pool is very large. Great for lap swimmers. You don't see many pools this big in the Pattaya area. However, you should be aware the Cliff does not want short-term renters. They require renters to sign a 30-day lease. Otherwise, renters are violating the Hotel Act of Thailand. The Cliff has posted a warning of 10,000 baht fines if renting under 30 days.

M S wrote a review Aug 2017,50,Vacation Rental and Dental Treatment.,"The Cliff Residence Condo    Pattaya    Great Vacation and Dental Treatment    510850758    Since years I stayed in Pattaya for 2 to 3 month during the summer and rented an apartment. One of the newest apartment buildings is The Cliff. This 27 story building is located 4 blocks of the Gulf of Thailand and beach. The building is well secured, has an elegant lobby, Olympic size pool, children's pool, whirl pool, state of the art exercise room. Apartments can be rented for a minimum of 3 days starting at 1000 Baht per day for a studio, one and two bed rooms are also available. The in-house renting and selling agent is Property Studio Com. LTD. Talk to Nui she is very accommodating and helpful, tell her Manfred send you. This company also provide cleaning and laundry service, taxi, rental car and motor bike service.  The high sea-side floors have a great view of the Gulf of Thailand and the many islands in the background every apartment has a balcony. I rented apartments in this building for the last 3 years and found the best equipped apartment is 2214 with a 55' flat screen smart TV with soundbar, DVD and CD player, floor to ceiling windows and doors, a large wash machine and all the pots and pants. The apartment has a king size bed and a sleeper for two.The building is located in the hills outside of Pattaya, with no public transportation, a taxi ride to town is about $4, I rented motor scooter 2500 Baht a month to be mobile.  If you need dental work the Pattaya International Dental Center is a modern and very professional dental practice. During the years my treatments included 5 implants, 2 crowns, 1 root canal and never had a problem. make an appointment with Dr. Narin tell him Manfred send you.  You can reach Pattaya from the Bangkok Airport by bus that will take you to Jomtien, from here you can take a taxi to reach your hotel. I made a reservation with limousine service in Thailand they will meet you at the airport, the price is 1500 Baht for the approximately 90 min ride in a new and comfortable Toyota Camry, a real bargain.  When I arrive in Thailand first I make a hotel reservation for 2 days, since most flights are overnight. I sleep one day and make my apartment rental arrangement the next day, hotels in walking distance are Cosy Beach hotel, or Royal Cliff Beach and Royal Cliff Grande. The exchange rate in the summer of 2017 was $1=33.5 baht.","THE CLIFF RESIDENCE CONDO - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.920938,100.862602&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.920938,100.862602&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.928483,100.862694|12.924710,100.867577|12.920770,100.866524|12.923032,100.868019|12.925503,100.871490|12.925854,100.871498|12.921944,100.866280|12.925252,100.870277&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923379,100.859665|12.923672,100.873116|12.911025,100.860687|12.922490,100.859955|12.924771,100.860611|12.910872,100.861397|12.923467,100.859528|12.926645,100.861610|12.926686,100.861847&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.922674,100.859497|12.924386,100.859207|12.923552,100.859947|12.923232,100.859421|12.925546,100.861938|12.913719,100.867088|12.923741,100.869438|12.921500,100.859299|12.922292,100.863571&signature=THLpU00kvbc9VjVc43wv9pbGrIM="

John N wrote a review Oct 2016,40,The Best Place To Stay In Pattaya,"In my opinion Cosy Beach is the best place to stay in Pattaya. Nice quiet area that is only a 10 minute taxi ride to the hustle and bustle of Walking Street.  Our one bedroom apartment at The Cliff Residence Condo had a small kitchen and lounge room, a nice modern bathroom and bedroom with king size bed.  The view was great from our balcony and we were about 10 minutes walk to the beach with some nice little restaurants along the way.  We had two issues that were a little annoying. Firstly, the pool slide wasn't working and looked like it hadn't worked for a while. Not a big issue but we did pick this hotel because of the pool as the grandson was coming over to stay once or twice.  Secondly, we arrived expecting to pay cash for our stay as this is a condo, not a hotel. But we arrived on a Sunday and there were no staff around. So, the security guard gave us our room key and had no further information for us. It took 3 days to work out how and where to pay. No staff we spoke to knew anything about accepting payment. If it had taken 6 days to work it out we would have been on our way home, money intact.","THE CLIFF RESIDENCE CONDO - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.920938,100.862602&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.920938,100.862602&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.928483,100.862694|12.924710,100.867577|12.920770,100.866524|12.923032,100.868019|12.925503,100.871490|12.925854,100.871498|12.921944,100.866280|12.925252,100.870277&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923379,100.859665|12.923672,100.873116|12.911025,100.860687|12.922490,100.859955|12.924771,100.860611|12.910872,100.861397|12.923467,100.859528|12.926645,100.861610|12.926686,100.861847&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.922674,100.859497|12.924386,100.859207|12.923552,100.859947|12.923232,100.859421|12.925546,100.861938|12.913719,100.867088|12.923741,100.869438|12.921500,100.859299|12.922292,100.863571&signature=THLpU00kvbc9VjVc43wv9pbGrIM="

Edwin G wrote a review Apr 2016,50,"One of the best condos in Pattaya, 300m to the beach and awesome pool.","As i live in the building for a while, had to leave review for guidance and some info.  They have 6 sizes of rooms, 38,48,72,74,91,102sq.m~  Very nice 46m. long pool, with fun slider, saunas gym.  Location is very nice and close to the beach but not for public transport, though there are many motorbike, and car taxies waiting downstairs, plenty of small shops and restaurants, some new very posh places wits perfect sea views.  If you are renting, using various sites to book, prices can vary dramatically.  Overall very nice place to live and to enjoy holiday or long term living.  Hope to see you here!","THE CLIFF RESIDENCE CONDO - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.920938,100.862602&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.920938,100.862602&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.928483,100.862694|12.924710,100.867577|12.920770,100.866524|12.923032,100.868019|12.925503,100.871490|12.925854,100.871498|12.921944,100.866280|12.925252,100.870277&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923379,100.859665|12.923672,100.873116|12.911025,100.860687|12.922490,100.859955|12.924771,100.860611|12.910872,100.861397|12.923467,100.859528|12.926645,100.861610|12.926686,100.861847&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.922674,100.859497|12.924386,100.859207|12.923552,100.859947|12.923232,100.859421|12.925546,100.861938|12.913719,100.867088|12.923741,100.869438|12.921500,100.859299|12.922292,100.863571&signature=THLpU00kvbc9VjVc43wv9pbGrIM="
funkynan wrote a review Feb 2016,30,A place to lay your head,"The condo was great, it had a kitchenette + a balcony although it was a bit to hot for us to sit out, there was also a lot of construction around new places being built.  The pool looked inviting, although we were only there two nights so didn't get opportunity to try it out!  Could have been better equipped I.e. Only one mug and no duvet!

Morten M wrote a review Jul 2015,50,Amazing,"This building is located right outside the hustle and bustle of Pattaya C.  It's 300 meter from one of the better beaches of Pattaya called Cosy Beach. But it's the pool area that really impressed me. - It's very beautiful and right next to the pool there is a well equipped gym.  The building is high end and everything is well maintained. The Wifi is the fastest I have tried in Thailand. The reception is open from 9 AM - 6 PM.  The area is quiet and a lot greener then the rest of Pattaya Central. But You are still very close to everything.  Walking Street, which is the nightlife center of Pattaya starts only 1,3 km away next to the Bali Hai Pier. This place is also where you drive fast go-cards and catch a cheap 30 min. ferry to the nearby island of Koh Lan. My warmest recommendations for this place. I really enjoyed it.","THE CLIFF RESIDENCE CONDO - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.920938,100.862602&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.920938,100.862602&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.928483,100.862694|12.924710,100.867577|12.920770,100.866524|12.923032,100.868019|12.925503,100.871490|12.925854,100.871498|12.921944,100.866280|12.925252,100.870277&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923379,100.859665|12.923672,100.873116|12.911025,100.860687|12.922490,100.859955|12.924771,100.860611|12.910872,100.861397|12.923467,100.859528|12.926645,100.861610|12.926686,100.861847&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.922674,100.859497|12.924386,100.859207|12.923552,100.859947|12.923232,100.859421|12.925546,100.861938|12.913719,100.867088|12.923741,100.869438|12.921500,100.859299|12.922292,100.863571&signature=THLpU00kvbc9VjVc43wv9pbGrIM="
