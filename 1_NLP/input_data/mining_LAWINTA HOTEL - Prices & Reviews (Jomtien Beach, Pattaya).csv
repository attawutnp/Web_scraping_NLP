Coffee Chill wrote a review Mar 2020,50,LawinTa De Lovely,"The LawinTa Hotel is simply superb. It sits in an elevated position, adjacent to the busy Rompho Market, in the middle of a quiet side street off the main arterial road, in and out of town. I found it was an easy walk to the beach. I also enjoyed a 'sea glimpse' from my spacious studio room, with its modern and funky decor, another pleasing aspect to my stay here. The magnificent rooftop pool with it's panoramic views of the city and the water, was a major highlight of an all-round positive accommodation experience. I went for many swims (and breakfasts - do try the in-house restaurant) during my short stay. If you are looking for a comfortable, mid-range place to stay in Jomtien (?), then I suggest that you put LawinTa Hotel (see my Coffee Chill TV YouTube Video) on your short list.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="

Neilerosen wrote a review Jul 2019,50,ONE OF THE BEST,"The reason why this hotel is so good is because the hotels own description IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU GET. No lies No photo shopped photos and 99.99 per cent of the staff were so polite, kind and helpful it was amazing. Is it a 3 star or 4 star hotel i don't care it offered 5 star treatment. Rooms clean and FULLY equipped with all anybody would need . As i have been visiting the Jomtein area for more than 30 years i have stayed at lots of different hotels but my future home will be Lawinta Hotel on my 3 visits a year. Its a 7 minute walk to the beach which i did everyday . Whatever you need , food shops restaurants etc are all available nearby. Yes they cater for groups of Chinese tourists but this was not a problem or had any effect on how much i enjoyed this Hotel. Thank you Lawinta for being such a lovely place to stay for my 15 days. See you again soon.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="
Arve wrote a review Mar 2019,40,"Worth the money for short term stay, not long term.","Part one -  So far we stayed 1 week and are going to stay 3 weeks more. The hotel is worth the money. Service minded both in reception, restaurant(breakfast) and housekeeping. The room have a good bed size, comfortable, good size room and clean. The hotel is quiet new but already we can see that it needs abit freshing up. That is normal in Thailand I think from experience. French balcony. Pool in 8th floor is good but miss a bar. I guess it’s possible to order from restaurant 1. Floor. Only 5 sun beds. Breakfast is buffet or set menu. You can have set menu in room. We would expect more from the buffet but we are happy to know that we could ask for eggs in different ways, bacon and yoghurt. Hope that will be part of the buffet in future so the guest do not need to ask for it every day. The fitness room is ok but miss more equipment. Like manuals/free weights. There is a outdoor gym just 50 m from the hotel that you can pay extra for(not belonging to the hotel, 700bath for 2 weeks). Last but not least we hope for a room upgrade some time during stay since we decided to stay her for 26 nights. Would be appreciated. We are happy so far and would recommend staying here.    Part two- after 4 weeks.  As a long stay guest I’m sorry to say your hotel still have enough to work on. Your staff is still working hard and do their best to be service minded. That we appreciate! After 4weeks stay we expect abit more from the management of the hotel. It’s normal to do some changes to the breakfast that is offered not to get too bored of the food for long time stay. Also a offer of upgrade of the room would be appreciated and/or at least a offer of late check out last day without charge (we declined the offer of 500bath for extra 4hours), would have cost nothing for the hotel to offer long stay guest. What about a fruit surprise in the room or something to say that we appreciate that we decided to stay longer than what is usual? Anyway we still would recommend short term stay and perhaps we would stay again for a week or so but sorry no longer. By the way, our room were booked with balcony. I recommend you write French balcony as it is not space for a chair. Thanks anyway.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="
Maria M wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Excellent hotel!,"We stayed at this new hotel during about 2 weeks and it was great. The staff ia polite, helpful, always smiling and ready to help. Every time you return to the hotel you fell like the dearest friend, not just an ordinary hotel guest.  The location is great, about 10 min by foot to the beach, 1 min to the nearest 7-eleven shop, 3 min to the market, where you can buy fruits, vegetables during the entire day and also eat some tasty food after 6 p.m.  The room is spacious. Since the hotel is new, everything works great. We enjoyed also the view from the room (we wee on 7 floor) to the sea and the main road, from the big window (from floor to ceiling). The air conditioner works good and is also equipped witn antibacterial filter. The cleaning is carried out daily. Beach towels are also provided daily.  The breakfast is delicious. We also visited the restaurant of the hotel for dinner and lunch, it as great. The prices are moderate, the food is delicions ad the service is nice.  The swimming pool is located on the room, it is good for relaxig swimming. There are enough sunbeds, chairs and tables in the swimming pool area.    We recommend the hotel for everybody, looking for relaxing holiday in Pattaya.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="

jeremycope1 wrote a review Jan 2018,30,The Seafood Restaurant,"I only used the restaurant of this new hotel, called the Seafood restaurant. I live nearby when in Thailand and thought I would pop in. We were the only customers at the time of 4pm. A clean and smart enough place - probably used mainly by it's customers staying at the hotel. The prices are pretty reasonable. I had Spaghetti cabanora and my friend a Thai dish which I cannot recall the name of. We each had a glass of the white house wine (110 Bhts each). The one Thai waiter was very pleasant and very chatty with my Thai friend - I think the waiter was pleased to have someone to converse with - good luck to him.    It is unlikely anyone would just 'drop in' to this place as it is somewhat off the beaten track - basically a stiff 5 minute walk down to the sea and its plethora of eateries. But having said that we enjoyes ourselves.    Total price 577.80 Bhts which included VAT 7%. Although it said on the menu a service charge would be made of 7% that was not the case.

TomOrr wrote a review Sep 2017,50,"Great hotel, friendly staff, great location","Stayed here for 5 nights, chosen mainly for its proximity to the beach and the entertainment centres. The hotel is relatively new so is still shiny and everything works. The rate for low season was good and included 2 breakfasts daily. The choice of breakfast was above average and the chef made a point of asking us every morning if he could rustle up something not on the buffet such as noodles, fried rice or omelettes.    Free hint: The hotel has many coaches of Chinese tourists so if you don't want to fight for the buffet wait till later as they all got up and left very early to take todays photographs.    Excellent infinity swimming pool on the roof but with no staffing, towels or a bar we didn't use it much.    It was a very short walk to many, many bars and restaurants, and despite being across from the bar complex at Rompho Market, was quiet at nights. There is also an excellent street food market just around the corner. I would definitely re book this hotel on any return trip to Jomtien.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="
Coffee Chill wrote a review Mar 2020,50,LawinTa De Lovely,"The LawinTa Hotel is simply superb. It sits in an elevated position, adjacent to the busy Rompho Market, in the middle of a quiet side street off the main arterial road, in and out of town. I found it was an easy walk to the beach. I also enjoyed a 'sea glimpse' from my spacious studio room, with its modern and funky decor, another pleasing aspect to my stay here. The magnificent rooftop pool with it's panoramic views of the city and the water, was a major highlight of an all-round positive accommodation experience. I went for many swims (and breakfasts - do try the in-house restaurant) during my short stay. If you are looking for a comfortable, mid-range place to stay in Jomtien (?), then I suggest that you put LawinTa Hotel (see my Coffee Chill TV YouTube Video) on your short list.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="

No lies No photo shopped photos and 99.99 per cent of the staff were so polite, kind and helpful it was amazing. Is it a 3 star or 4 star hotel i don't care it offered 5 star treatment. Rooms clean and FULLY equipped with all anybody would need . As i have been visiting the Jomtein area for more than 30 years i have stayed at lots of different hotels but my future home will be Lawinta Hotel on my 3 visits a year. Its a 7 minute walk to the beach which i did everyday . Whatever you need , food shops restaurants etc are all available nearby. Yes they cater for groups of Chinese tourists but this was not a problem or had any effect on how much i enjoyed this Hotel. Thank you Lawinta for being such a lovely place to stay for my 15 days.

Arve wrote a review Mar 2019,40,"Worth the money for short term stay, not long term.","Part one -  So far we stayed 1 week and are going to stay 3 weeks more. The hotel is worth the money. Service minded both in reception, restaurant(breakfast) and housekeeping. The room have a good bed size, comfortable, good size room and clean. The hotel is quiet new but already we can see that it needs abit freshing up. That is normal in Thailand I think from experience. French balcony. Pool in 8th floor is good but miss a bar. I guess it’s possible to order from restaurant 1. Floor. Only 5 sun beds. Breakfast is buffet or set menu. You can have set menu in room. We would expect more from the buffet but we are happy to know that we could ask for eggs in different ways, bacon and yoghurt. Hope that will be part of the buffet in future so the guest do not need to ask for it every day. The fitness room is ok but miss more equipment. Like manuals/free weights. There is a outdoor gym just 50 m from the hotel that you can pay extra for(not belonging to the hotel, 700bath for 2 weeks). Last but not least we hope for a room upgrade some time during stay since we decided to stay her for 26 nights. Would be appreciated. We are happy so far and would recommend staying here.    Part two- after 4 weeks.  As a long stay guest I’m sorry to say your hotel still have enough to work on. Your staff is still working hard and do their best to be service minded. That we appreciate! After 4weeks stay we expect abit more from the management of the hotel. It’s normal to do some changes to the breakfast that is offered not to get too bored of the food for long time stay. Also a offer of upgrade of the room would be appreciated and/or at least a offer of late check out last day without charge (we declined the offer of 500bath for extra 4hours), would have cost nothing for the hotel to offer long stay guest. What about a fruit surprise in the room or something to say that we appreciate that we decided to stay longer than what is usual? Anyway we still would recommend short term stay and perhaps we would stay again for a week or so but sorry no longer. By the way, our room were booked with balcony. I recommend you write French balcony as it is not space for a chair.

Maria M wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Excellent hotel!,"We stayed at this new hotel during about 2 weeks and it was great. The staff ia polite, helpful, always smiling and ready to help. Every time you return to the hotel you fell like the dearest friend, not just an ordinary hotel guest.  The location is great, about 10 min by foot to the beach, 1 min to the nearest 7-eleven shop, 3 min to the market, where you can buy fruits, vegetables during the entire day and also eat some tasty food after 6 p.m.  The room is spacious. Since the hotel is new, everything works great. We enjoyed also the view from the room (we wee on 7 floor) to the sea and the main road, from the big window (from floor to ceiling). The air conditioner works good and is also equipped witn antibacterial filter. The cleaning is carried out daily. Beach towels are also provided daily.  The breakfast is delicious. We also visited the restaurant of the hotel for dinner and lunch, it as great. The prices are moderate, the food is delicions ad the service is nice.  The swimming pool is located on the room, it is good for relaxig swimming. There are enough sunbeds, chairs and tables in the swimming pool area.    We recommend the hotel for everybody, looking for relaxing holiday in Pattaya.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="

jeremycope1 wrote a review Jan 2018,30,The Seafood Restaurant,"I only used the restaurant of this new hotel, called the Seafood restaurant. I live nearby when in Thailand and thought I would pop in. We were the only customers at the time of 4pm. A clean and smart enough place - probably used mainly by it's customers staying at the hotel. The prices are pretty reasonable. I had Spaghetti cabanora and my friend a Thai dish which I cannot recall the name of. We each had a glass of the white house wine (110 Bhts each). The one Thai waiter was very pleasant and very chatty with my Thai friend - I think the waiter was pleased to have someone to converse with - good luck to him.    It is unlikely anyone would just 'drop in' to this place as it is somewhat off the beaten track - basically a stiff 5 minute walk down to the sea and its plethora of eateries. But having said that we enjoyes ourselves.    Total price 577.80 Bhts which included VAT 7%. Although it said on the menu a service charge would be made of 7% that was not the case.

TomOrr wrote a review Sep 2017,50,"Great hotel, friendly staff, great location","Stayed here for 5 nights, chosen mainly for its proximity to the beach and the entertainment centres. The hotel is relatively new so is still shiny and everything works. The rate for low season was good and included 2 breakfasts daily. The choice of breakfast was above average and the chef made a point of asking us every morning if he could rustle up something not on the buffet such as noodles, fried rice or omelettes.    Free hint: The hotel has many coaches of Chinese tourists so if you don't want to fight for the buffet wait till later as they all got up and left very early to take todays photographs.    Excellent infinity swimming pool on the roof but with no staffing, towels or a bar we didn't use it much.    It was a very short walk to many, many bars and restaurants, and despite being across from the bar complex at Rompho Market, was quiet at nights. There is also an excellent street food market just around the corner. I would definitely re book this hotel on any return trip to Jomtien.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="
Coffee Chill wrote a review Mar 2020,50,LawinTa De Lovely,"The LawinTa Hotel is simply superb. It sits in an elevated position, adjacent to the busy Rompho Market, in the middle of a quiet side street off the main arterial road, in and out of town. I found it was an easy walk to the beach. I also enjoyed a 'sea glimpse' from my spacious studio room, with its modern and funky decor, another pleasing aspect to my stay here. The magnificent rooftop pool with it's panoramic views of the city and the water, was a major highlight of an all-round positive accommodation experience. I went for many swims (and breakfasts - do try the in-house restaurant) during my short stay. If you are looking for a comfortable, mid-range place to stay in Jomtien (?), then I suggest that you put LawinTa Hotel (see my Coffee Chill TV YouTube Video) on your short list.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="

Neilerosen wrote a review Jul 2019,50,ONE OF THE BEST,"The reason why this hotel is so good is because the hotels own description IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU GET. No lies No photo shopped photos and 99.99 per cent of the staff were so polite, kind and helpful it was amazing. Is it a 3 star or 4 star hotel i don't care it offered 5 star treatment. Rooms clean and FULLY equipped with all anybody would need . As i have been visiting the Jomtein area for more than 30 years i have stayed at lots of different hotels but my future home will be Lawinta Hotel on my 3 visits a year. Its a 7 minute walk to the beach which i did everyday . Whatever you need , food shops restaurants etc are all available nearby. Yes they cater for groups of Chinese tourists but this was not a problem or had any effect on how much i enjoyed this Hotel. Thank you Lawinta for being such a lovely place to stay for my 15 days. See you again soon.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="
Arve wrote a review Mar 2019,40,"Worth the money for short term stay, not long term.","Part one -  So far we stayed 1 week and are going to stay 3 weeks more. The hotel is worth the money. Service minded both in reception, restaurant(breakfast) and housekeeping. The room have a good bed size, comfortable, good size room and clean. The hotel is quiet new but already we can see that it needs abit freshing up. That is normal in Thailand I think from experience. French balcony. Pool in 8th floor is good but miss a bar. I guess it’s possible to order from restaurant 1. Floor. Only 5 sun beds. Breakfast is buffet or set menu. You can have set menu in room. We would expect more from the buffet but we are happy to know that we could ask for eggs in different ways, bacon and yoghurt. Hope that will be part of the buffet in future so the guest do not need to ask for it every day. The fitness room is ok but miss more equipment. Like manuals/free weights. There is a outdoor gym just 50 m from the hotel that you can pay extra for(not belonging to the hotel, 700bath for 2 weeks). Last but not least we hope for a room upgrade some time during stay since we decided to stay her for 26 nights. Would be appreciated. We are happy so far and would recommend staying here.    Part two- after 4 weeks.  As a long stay guest I’m sorry to say your hotel still have enough to work on. Your staff is still working hard and do their best to be service minded. That we appreciate! After 4weeks stay we expect abit more from the management of the hotel. It’s normal to do some changes to the breakfast that is offered not to get too bored of the food for long time stay. Also a offer of upgrade of the room would be appreciated and/or at least a offer of late check out last day without charge (we declined the offer of 500bath for extra 4hours), would have cost nothing for the hotel to offer long stay guest. What about a fruit surprise in the room or something to say that we appreciate that we decided to stay longer than what is usual? Anyway we still would recommend short term stay and perhaps we would stay again for a week or so but sorry no longer. By the way, our room were booked with balcony. I recommend you write French balcony as it is not space for a chair. Thanks anyway.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="
Maria M wrote a review Dec 2018,50,Excellent hotel!,"We stayed at this new hotel during about 2 weeks and it was great. The staff ia polite, helpful, always smiling and ready to help. Every time you return to the hotel you fell like the dearest friend, not just an ordinary hotel guest.  The location is great, about 10 min by foot to the beach, 1 min to the nearest 7-eleven shop, 3 min to the market, where you can buy fruits, vegetables during the entire day and also eat some tasty food after 6 p.m.  The room is spacious. Since the hotel is new, everything works great. We enjoyed also the view from the room (we wee on 7 floor) to the sea and the main road, from the big window (from floor to ceiling). The air conditioner works good and is also equipped witn antibacterial filter. The cleaning is carried out daily. Beach towels are also provided daily.  The breakfast is delicious. We also visited the restaurant of the hotel for dinner and lunch, it as great. The prices are moderate, the food is delicions ad the service is nice.  The swimming pool is located on the room, it is good for relaxig swimming. There are enough sunbeds, chairs and tables in the swimming pool area.    We recommend the hotel for everybody, looking for relaxing holiday in Pattaya.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="

jeremycope1 wrote a review Jan 2018,30,The Seafood Restaurant,"I only used the restaurant of this new hotel, called the Seafood restaurant. I live nearby when in Thailand and thought I would pop in. We were the only customers at the time of 4pm. A clean and smart enough place - probably used mainly by it's customers staying at the hotel. The prices are pretty reasonable. I had Spaghetti cabanora and my friend a Thai dish which I cannot recall the name of. We each had a glass of the white house wine (110 Bhts each). The one Thai waiter was very pleasant and very chatty with my Thai friend - I think the waiter was pleased to have someone to converse with - good luck to him.    It is unlikely anyone would just 'drop in' to this place as it is somewhat off the beaten track - basically a stiff 5 minute walk down to the sea and its plethora of eateries. But having said that we enjoyes ourselves.    Total price 577.80 Bhts which included VAT 7%. Although it said on the menu a service charge would be made of 7% that was not the case. We left our own tip.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="
TomOrr wrote a review Sep 2017,50,"Great hotel, friendly staff, great location","Stayed here for 5 nights, chosen mainly for its proximity to the beach and the entertainment centres. The hotel is relatively new so is still shiny and everything works. The rate for low season was good and included 2 breakfasts daily. The choice of breakfast was above average and the chef made a point of asking us every morning if he could rustle up something not on the buffet such as noodles, fried rice or omelettes.    Free hint: The hotel has many coaches of Chinese tourists so if you don't want to fight for the buffet wait till later as they all got up and left very early to take todays photographs.    Excellent infinity swimming pool on the roof but with no staffing, towels or a bar we didn't use it much.    It was a very short walk to many, many bars and restaurants, and despite being across from the bar complex at Rompho Market, was quiet at nights. There is also an excellent street food market just around the corner. I would definitely re book this hotel on any return trip to Jomtien.","LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897381,100.874458&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897381,100.874458|12.897381,100.874458&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.896044,100.870407|12.894398,100.874542|12.896280,100.870598|12.897946,100.871475&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.897312,100.871132|12.897419,100.870224|12.896570,100.870392|12.900847,100.874405|12.893725,100.873589|12.894294,100.874367|12.894560,100.871880|12.897535,100.872559&signature=en-9JhHPxtW1DD1M_eJ1MKw9keY="
