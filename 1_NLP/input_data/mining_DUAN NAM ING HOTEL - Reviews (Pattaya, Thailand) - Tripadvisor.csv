SnapCooeee wrote a review Feb 2020,30,"Quite OK, but the owners need to improve the premises.","My friend and I moved to this hotel for 9 nights because the hotel down the road would not reduce their price for a week or more stay. The hotel published photos on the internet are definitely old. In reality everything is very worn or run down, including the pool area. THE POOL WAS CLEAN.    Having said that, I WOULD STAY AGAIN!    The rooms are very spacious, equipped with basic toiletries and water. No kettle, but there is a cold and hot water dispenser downstairs near the reception desk. Nook (นุก) on reception, was invaluable. She helped us immensely! If it wasn’t for her, my rating would be lower.    Cons: No lift, but we were only on the second floor. Rooms needed deep cleaning and dusting. I’m guessing management doesn’t pay their staff enough for a thorough job. Management/owner needs to SPEND A LITTLE MONEY on furniture restoration. If you are a light sleeper, pay extra for a Pool side room OR take ear plugs.    Pros: Great location. Nice pool. Big rooms. Nook (นุก). Large fridge. Comfy bed. Good internet, sat TV, air con and hot water.","DUAN NAM ING HOTEL - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928950,100.884911&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928950,100.884911&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=yc-3H9VbsK3ZHNUC90c9lj1JChY="
Graham W wrote a review Dec 2018,40,Great location,"Perfect location on Soi Buakhao as it is close to many eateries, bars etc. Although the hotel is a bit tired it is spotlessly clean and the staff from front desk to the cleaners are very friendly and helpful. The swimming pool is always clean and has plenty of sunbeds and is usually very quiet. On a room tip I would always ask for a poolside room as we initially had a street side room but found it extremely noisy until the early hours.","DUAN NAM ING HOTEL - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928950,100.884911&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928950,100.884911&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=yc-3H9VbsK3ZHNUC90c9lj1JChY="

cmsflorence wrote a review Sep 2016,40,Great Friendly Hotel for the Money,I have stayed at this hotel many times over the years. It is a very cheap area filled with good little restaurants and with access to all the sites. The staff will remember you and make sure that you are in the room that you want. A very nice and clean pool is a refreshing experience after a day of walking around.    The hotel rooms are comfortable and clean. They could use a bit of updating as they have not changed over the years.

Gary094 wrote a review Jan 2016,30,Hotel Ok,"Stayed here again now a 2nd time, only because all other hotels nearby booked out over the xmas/Nye period.  Rooms are ok, cleaned everyday , the standard rooms just have a small wet bathroom, the water from shower goes everywhere & the shower hose was short which made it even worse.  The ""delux"" rooms have an enclosed shower and a 4 poster bed with light curtains around it ( see Pics).  Wifi is near non existent , rarely worked I was on 2nd floor.  The pool was good , had a lot of shade in afternoons as surrounded by larger blds., couple of days they ran out of pool towels if u went to pool after lunch, just had to use room towels , didn't bother me too much.  Friendly reception & cleaning staff.  Oneday I got back to hotel and asked for key, I went upstairs & it wouldn't work, I was given the wrong key , to a room on a higher level at other end of bld. this wasn't good , if a dishonest person took it could of went through a other persons room.  Rooms have no safe , but they have security boxes behind reception which I felt safe & had no probs with.  Booking rooms with hotel via email wasn't easy as they don't always return emails, lot easier to book with Agoda.  Has no lift so try & get rooms on 2nd floor if u have heavy bags, & try get room at back of hotel overlooking pool as rooms at front get all noise from the bars, loud music ppl screaming till early hrs of the morning.  better hotels nearby for about same price. only stay again if others booked out.","DUAN NAM ING HOTEL - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928950,100.884911&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928950,100.884911&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=yc-3H9VbsK3ZHNUC90c9lj1JChY="
Joe A wrote a review Dec 2015,10,Noisy muslime people from iran - no sleep possible,"No sleep possible because some noisy men from iran were in the room above me, came back drunk in the night every day and made party together in one room with their ladies. Several complains with reception and the manager can not fix the problem. These muslim people didnt want to stop their disturbing behaviour. Normally the hotelmanager had to check out this people after they didnt want to change their behaviour disturbing other guests. But this people rented 4 rooms and the hotel maybe didnt want to loose money. But now they loose two long time customers, Me and my friend. They can put people like that inside, but they have to live with the decision of others who want a relaxing holiday. In other hotels these People had to check out after didnt want to change their behaviour.

Nick M wrote a review Jul 2015,40,You get what you pay for and what you get for your money is more than acceptable.,"I have stayed at this Hotel many times. It is cheap by comparison but it needs to be appreciated for what it is. Rooms can vary in condition, eg quality of the aircon, fridge, bed and shower. If you are spending a lot of time in your room then maybe check somewhere else. I find it quiet (poolside rooms) the staff are friendly and the pool is relaxing. I use it as a base to explore the region so only sleep and use it to refresh before I head out. It is close to all amenities and is out of the way of the hustle and bustle. Never had a problem with the security of my belongings in the room and the linen and room is cleaned daily.

Glahamuk wrote a review May 2015,40,Best cheapie with pool in town,"Currently walk in rates are running from B700 per night. If you can get over the colour of the hotel it's a great place to stay. Stayed in multiple rooms here now and never had a problem or issues with any of the rooms. Poolside rooms are the quietest and lower floor rooms are the most expensive.  Booking system is a bit antiquated, ideal for walk ins though. Staff as friendly and helpful as ever.","DUAN NAM ING HOTEL - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928950,100.884911&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928950,100.884911&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=yc-3H9VbsK3ZHNUC90c9lj1JChY="

Although not on beach front it has lots of shops and restaurants around it and is only 5 minutes walk to beach. It is very clean and old fashioned hotel with huge rooms including full size fridge. It fairly basic, no tea/ coffee making etc and no breakfast or food. Small restaurants around sell breakfast for $4 to $5. It is extremely cheap and great value for money.

lpool63 wrote a review Jan 2015,10,Overpriced pink hostel,"I stayed at this hotel over Xmas and new year on the recommendation of a friend, What a big mistake!!!!  The hotel looks like it was constructed in the sixties with its pink dull décor, the whole hotel is in serious need of refurbishment, rooms are dark and dull with furniture to match, fridge was unhygienic with rusting grills inside, balcony was showing signs of decay and looked dangerous. ( see my photos). The air-con in our room just pumped out hot air all night, they could not adjust the temperature so we had to make do with a fan from reception!  We had booked a second room for family members for three nights over the new year, upon check in they told us their room wasn't available as it was double booked by an agent for the hotel and offered us an alternative hotel nearby. We refused their offer and booked the hotel next door for our family. The hotel had our contact number in Thailand for three months, strange how they couldn't find the time to call and inform us of the problem . VERY POOR MANAGEMENT. Looking at previous reviews on this hotel we are not the first to have this booking problem .  This is an overpriced budget hotel who's main clients are middle aged european men who come to Pattaya on a budget for the sex tourism.  The only plus point I found was the lovely staff who have to work in this dump, they where always polite with a typical Thai smile . A special mention to the Ladyboy receptionist, night shift receptionist and night shift security guard !    My room tip is to find one in a different hotel !!!!!!!","DUAN NAM ING HOTEL - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928950,100.884911&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928950,100.884911&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=yc-3H9VbsK3ZHNUC90c9lj1JChY="

Bundyrum_7 wrote a review Mar 2014,30,Third Stay Not So Good!!!,"Stayed here in Nov 2013 for the 3rd time. Very disappointed this time around. After making a booking earlier in the year and clarifying by email many times, we arrived at around 11pm to only be told that they had NO rooms available until the following day. After explaining and showing them copies of the emails, they were not interested, but apologised for the inconvenience. We were then told that they would find us another Hotel for the night, which they did, at a more expensive price, but we had no choice. We also had to place a deposit to hold rooms for us for the next day. After all this run around, and to add more stress, it was now well after midnight and all the money changes were closed. Went back to this Hotel and asked (after much confusion from the receptionist) if we could change money from her. This request was denied, but finally talked her into giving us a small amount in exchange for $200 and we would replace that amount the next day. This is now after 1am. We are tired, hot, frustrated, stressed and very unhappy campers at this point. The next day, we sorted out our rooms and were finally settled. Two days later, I was speaking to 2 other guests at the Pool.........And to our amazement........this also happened to them!!!!!! I WILL not stay there again!!!!!

Jimb0151 wrote a review Sep 2012,40,little gem,"stayed there now four times. Right in the middle of Pattaya and on Soi Buakaw where there are many bars and restaurants.Close to all amenities. Rooms are basic and standard but great value for money. Pool facing rooms are baht 50 more than road facing rooms. No lift but not a problem as there are only two flights of stairs to climb. However, the chambermaids will carry your luggage on their backs to your room. No bar area but beers are only baht 50 each. They have a small coffee shop/restaurant outside front entrance and will deliver food and drinks to your room or poolside.There is a money exchange outside front entrance offering best exchange rate in town. All rooms have ac and able tv with balcony, decent sized. No in-room safe but deposit boxes in reception. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Am returning there in a few weeks.","DUAN NAM ING HOTEL - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928950,100.884911&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928950,100.884911&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=yc-3H9VbsK3ZHNUC90c9lj1JChY="
Bundyrum_7 wrote a review Nov 2011,40,Good Motel,"Stayed here for 11 nights, and at 800B a night, found it very affordable and quiet, except for the construction around you, but that is happening everywhere in Pattaya. Air-con, TV, fridge, has a balcony and has 3 floors. Unfortunately there is no lift, but I didn't find that as a problem. There is no Restaurant, but one is in progress and should be finished soon. Eating is not a problem though as there are many Restaurants and Cafes everywhere. The staff are excellent and very friendly. A safety deposit box for you is downstairs at reception. The rooms do need a ceiling fan though, as the Air-con can get cold. Other than that, I found this place very good and plan to stay there on my next trip. Great location and only a few minutes walk to the massive nightlife.","DUAN NAM ING HOTEL - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928950,100.884911&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928950,100.884911&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=yc-3H9VbsK3ZHNUC90c9lj1JChY="
eddibabyyeah wrote a review May 2011,40,Very Friendly,This was my third stay at Duan Nam Ing and as before it was nice and friendly. I had planned to stay at another hotel close by. But they messed up on my booking and I ended up in Pattaya in the middle of Songkran without a hotel. I called in at Duan Nam Ing on the off chance they had a room. And was lucky enough to get a room poolside for 800bht. Which is pretty good during Songkran.    The hotel itself is a typical no frills Pattaya hotel and is located on a busy soi in central Pattaya. Nice pool and all rooms have AC and cable TV. What makes this hotel stand out for me is the friendliness of the staff. The hotel is a family run business and this shows in the attitude and overall friendliness of all the staff. The two girls on reception were always polite and helpful and to me this is what makes this particular hotel stand out amongst its rivals close by.    The location of the hotel was perfect for me straight in the middle of the nightlife on Soi Buakhao. Its also on a busy songtel route. So you can get to walking street/beach road in about 5 mins for only 10baht. All in all the hotel was perfect for my requirements.,"DUAN NAM ING HOTEL - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928950,100.884911&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928950,100.884911&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=yc-3H9VbsK3ZHNUC90c9lj1JChY="
Zambezikid wrote a review Jun 2010,50,Great value for money,"What I like about this place is its great value for money.    The rooms are pretty good, though the bathroom could do with some sprucing up.    There's a TV, air-con, plenty of space, and either a balcony or sliding doors opening on to the swimming pool.    The pool is nice and just big enough to swim short lengths. The hotel has free wifi too.    The main downside is that it has no restaurant. There is a small bar which could make food and drinks but it never seems to be attended.    The location is acceptable if you know your way around Pattaya and are happy jumping on and off the 10 Baht buses.","DUAN NAM ING HOTEL - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928950,100.884911&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928950,100.884911&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=yc-3H9VbsK3ZHNUC90c9lj1JChY="
Glahamuk wrote a review Jun 2010,40,Good budget choice.,"First of all this hotel is in Pattaya,not chonburi.  I've rated this hotel according to it's budget status.  Spacious clean rooms with good bed linen,a/c, minibar ,tv,good water pressure in the bathroom.Large balcony.Nice swimming pool.  The only negative is no lift.  Current walk in rate is B700.  Next door is the brand new Nature View hotel run by the same people who run J&P court.Had a look at the rooms here and they are quality for the discounted price of B800 although the pool is not yet up and running.","DUAN NAM ING HOTEL - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928950,100.884911&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928950,100.884911&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=yc-3H9VbsK3ZHNUC90c9lj1JChY="
