Andy G wrote a review Nov 2021,50,Amazing boutique oasis,"We stayed in this villa on 25th to 28th Nov as a couple. We had room 303.    Overall we had a lovely time here, we will definitely stay again. We cannot fault one bit of this place, everything works, everything was pleasant, we were very comfortable, relaxed and felt welcome and at home. There was this atmosphere in the villa that the owners have where you just feel belonged and welcomed. If you like personal touch type of stay, defo recommend this! We have listed specific things we wanna share we very much liked in the place:    Fantastic Staff/services.  Hans the owner, his wife and the rest of the staff had provided us 5-star treatment and services. Example, we had ordered food from grab. It was so easy and we just asked them to receive and pay it for us (left money with them). Another was cleaning the room, whatever time, that suits us, we always come back with made up room, thoroughly cleaned too.    Excellent food.  My wife’s favourite is the Greek salad and the Swiss style sausage yum yum! They would serve us breakfast even though it was past 11am. Reasonably priced breakfast/ drinks. We came back after a day’s stroll when everything shuts, Hans served us beer and sat down with the other guests for a night cap. This was lovely.    Convenient location.  We drove here and found easy parking (on the road) next to the villa. It is walking distance to the beach, food places. There is a massage (Savanna) nearby. Close to family mart too.    Relaxing clean pool.  We spent a lot of time in the pool, when we came, it was quiet and we had the pool to ourselves (usually hang around midday until early afternoon). Staff were always available to take drink orders or food.    Other services.  We had asked them for laundry, they charge per item. Again, this was hassle free. We just left clothes at the front desk, and they brought it to the room, hung and nicely folded in the cupboards.    Thank you everyone at Swiss Paradise Boutique villa! You made our stay in Pattaya very comfortable and relaxing!","SWISS PARADISE BOUTIQUE VILLA - Prices & Lodge Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.958015,100.888489&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.958015,100.888489|12.958015,100.888489&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.958720,100.886070|12.959459,100.886894|12.957578,100.888878|12.956059,100.889862|12.958417,100.885742&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.955278,100.890602|12.958667,100.884949|12.958895,100.885231|12.957106,100.891983|12.956288,100.889046|12.958258,100.889267|12.955101,100.890587|12.958486,100.888756|12.958459,100.892700&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.958800,100.885796|12.959042,100.887306|12.953860,100.887932|12.959659,100.887077|12.956101,100.887009|12.960558,100.887566|12.959488,100.889458|12.957663,100.888779&signature=1bhT9Lh4oJJdOUqPfrLHWDuhtdk="
Allfreude wrote a review Nov 2019,50,An island of hospitality,"I visited the Swiss Paradise many times and in this case the high rating is really justified. At a crazy and often loud and dirty city Hans and his wife created a small but lovely hideaway. The hotel is located 400 meters from the bus service that brings you for 10 baht to the city. It’s not in the middle of town but close to a nice beach, if the word nice is trustworthy in Pattaya. The rooms are the cleanest I ever saw and walking bare feet through the hotel did not leave any dust on my feet. As other reviews already mentioned you find a big refrigerator, good beds, nice balconies, clean bathrooms with good showers and friendly stuff that proves that this is a place of respect and friendliness. It is a statement for the real Thailand me and my family love since decades. You will not find a fitness or a big restaurant but this easy to be found in the area around the hotel. The only negative point about die Swiss Paradies is that you have to leave one day. But you might come back one day!","SWISS PARADISE BOUTIQUE VILLA - Prices & Lodge Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.958015,100.888489&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.958015,100.888489|12.958015,100.888489&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.958720,100.886070|12.959459,100.886894|12.957578,100.888878|12.956059,100.889862|12.958417,100.885742&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.955278,100.890602|12.958667,100.884949|12.958895,100.885231|12.957106,100.891983|12.956288,100.889046|12.958258,100.889267|12.955101,100.890587|12.958486,100.888756|12.958459,100.892700&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.958800,100.885796|12.959042,100.887306|12.953860,100.887932|12.959659,100.887077|12.956101,100.887009|12.960558,100.887566|12.959488,100.889458|12.957663,100.888779&signature=1bhT9Lh4oJJdOUqPfrLHWDuhtdk="
vinvinmodh wrote a review Apr 2019,50,Great little hotel to stay in Pattaya,"It was ineed a pleasure to stay at this cozy hotel for a couple of nights. The Wongamat beach is just 5 minutes walk and many shops nearby too.  Terminal 21 would be not that walkable distance specially in the hot climate.  Rooms in the Hotel are very well decoated, neat and clean place. My room had balcony overlooking the swimming pool. Pool had lots of plants and a couple of trees around it, breakfast was not included in the room rate, but can be arranged for a small charge.  The family who owned the hotel are very experienced in running the hotel.

What a lovely hotel run by Swiss Thai couple. The host were very friendly and helpful as always. Highly clean room overlooking the swimming pool. Because it is a small hotel, I felt homely.

A soap dispenser or soap tablet near the sink in the bathroom ... if you want to wash your hands you have to walk into the shower area to get the soap ... not so good if you are dressed ready to go out and the shower area is still wet on the floor ...  2.

Property was so tranquil, lots of greens and plants, crisp and fresh environment makes it the No.1 choice for a relaxing getaway. Upon entering the premise, instantly felt how much hard work has been put in to maintain such high standard of living.

You could name it Sweet Paradise - such a lovely family owned place to stay. Located in a quiet area, however it took only a few minutes walk to the main street and take baht taxi (10 baht) to the center. Villa is clean and what really mattered: shower and toilet were clean and worked very well. Pick up from and to the AirPort was arranged.

Tatsuichiro wrote a review Nov 2016,50,"Wonderful stay, very welcoming owner","I really enjoyed my weekend stay at Swiss Paradise Boutique Villa. It is located in a very quiet neighborhood yet walking distance to main attractions in the north beach area.  It is a clean and charming boutique hotel with a very welcoming owner and staff. The room is exceptionally clean and bed is very comfortable, nicely decorated with matching furnitures with safe. Your own balcony is the nice place to sit and relax with fresh air beside hanging your wet swimwear.  I especially enjoyed talking with an owner during my stay. He shared his story of his life-long experiences in the hospitality business and that is what you do see and feel everywhere in this hotel. ""We offer Swiss management and Thai hospitality"" was the perfect fit to explain this lovely hotel. Thanks for helping me to get show ticket and reach to places. I really enjoyed talking with you and staying here.    I highly recommend this charming hotel and I hope if I could come back some day.","SWISS PARADISE BOUTIQUE VILLA - Prices & Lodge Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.958015,100.888489&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.958015,100.888489|12.958015,100.888489&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.958720,100.886070|12.959459,100.886894|12.957578,100.888878|12.956059,100.889862|12.958417,100.885742&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.955278,100.890602|12.958667,100.884949|12.958895,100.885231|12.957106,100.891983|12.956288,100.889046|12.958258,100.889267|12.955101,100.890587|12.958486,100.888756|12.958459,100.892700&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.958800,100.885796|12.959042,100.887306|12.953860,100.887932|12.959659,100.887077|12.956101,100.887009|12.960558,100.887566|12.959488,100.889458|12.957663,100.888779&signature=1bhT9Lh4oJJdOUqPfrLHWDuhtdk="

Jungwon B wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Best hotel ever. You won't regret,"I was looking for pricy hotel in Pattaya. I was keep looking and looking and found one. It was this hotel. It is not on the Walking street, so i hesitated... Cause i dont want the hotel to be too far from the main attractions.    Got to to the hotel. No more worries.  You can take Pattaya taxi(sungtaou?) from the bus terminal and get off. It only takes 10 to 15 mins.  When you go to the Walking street you can also take the public taxi cross the street. Takes no more than 20 mins. You can also walk to the beach.    It was just perfect hotel. Very clean. White floor with no single dirt. No water mold in the toilet.

The all-in hotel (comfortable rooms, bar, dining hall en swimming pool area) is super clean. And the hotel is located in a quieter area, with easy access to whatever you like to visit.  In the SWISS Paradise you really get value for money. Modest prices are offered.

The little swimming pool is surrounded by plants and flowers (a lot of orchidees) that Hans waters carefully everyday. The hotel is new and clean, a good value for money !","SWISS PARADISE BOUTIQUE VILLA - Prices & Lodge Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.958015,100.888489&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.958015,100.888489|12.958015,100.888489&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.958720,100.886070|12.959459,100.886894|12.957578,100.888878|12.956059,100.889862|12.958417,100.885742&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.955278,100.890602|12.958667,100.884949|12.958895,100.885231|12.957106,100.891983|12.956288,100.889046|12.958258,100.889267|12.955101,100.890587|12.958486,100.888756|12.958459,100.892700&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.958800,100.885796|12.959042,100.887306|12.953860,100.887932|12.959659,100.887077|12.956101,100.887009|12.960558,100.887566|12.959488,100.889458|12.957663,100.888779&signature=1bhT9Lh4oJJdOUqPfrLHWDuhtdk="

Easy_Flying wrote a review Aug 2015,50,The new Swiss run Paradise Boutique Villa - an oasis in a bustling city,"This newly opened place has deserved its name: it IS a true ""Paradise Boutique Villa"". You encounter a fresh and custom made building with somewhat 20 rooms or so, a tastefully fashioned little pool area and garden and all set up in a quiet neighborhood but not far away from Naklua Road where transportation to all the hot and less so spots is easily available.  But this Swiss run ""Paradise Boutique Villa"" not only captivates through its modern standard, the well-appointed rooms and in-room amenities: it is also a good value for the room rate asked. The general areas, too, are tastefully furbished in every detail with a lot of plants and nice little odds and ends everywhere again proving the premises' name. And finally: the owner-landlord looks pleasantly but unobtrusively after his guests: you can enjoy yourself there very well as a couple, as a family and certainly also as a solo traveler.","SWISS PARADISE BOUTIQUE VILLA - Prices & Lodge Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.958015,100.888489&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.958015,100.888489|12.958015,100.888489&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.958720,100.886070|12.959459,100.886894|12.957578,100.888878|12.956059,100.889862|12.958417,100.885742&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.955278,100.890602|12.958667,100.884949|12.958895,100.885231|12.957106,100.891983|12.956288,100.889046|12.958258,100.889267|12.955101,100.890587|12.958486,100.888756|12.958459,100.892700&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.958800,100.885796|12.959042,100.887306|12.953860,100.887932|12.959659,100.887077|12.956101,100.887009|12.960558,100.887566|12.959488,100.889458|12.957663,100.888779&signature=1bhT9Lh4oJJdOUqPfrLHWDuhtdk="

And we were impressed by this smallish hotel run by a Swiss. Rooms were spacious and well equipped, WiFi worked fast which is certainly not always the case in Thailand and the whole place was clean and tidy - the Swiss way. Its not far to walk to Pattaya - Nakluea Rd. where you get public transport.
