Noel Wanderer wrote a review Jul 2021,50,A hidden gem outside Pattaya,"If you think all 5-star swanky hotels looks increasingly similar, you are in for a treat at Villa Wanida. The design of the hotel aims to create a peaceful, cosy mini-jungle with ethnic furniture such as potteries and pavilions. If you are a horticulture-minded visitor, you will love the care and variety of flora and fauna there. The attention to the plants and trees is meticulous and tastefully done., hence the lushness of the place. The setting and surrounding is serene and hard to find in expensive hotels.  The two swimming pools are designed with a touch of cuteness. Plus the swings and the animal pottery decorations, I can see this is a good family accommodation. A safe and interesting place for kids to roam around.  The rooms are a little aged but the front porch is a lovely place to relax.  The breakfast is very good and generous and is a fusion of West-Thai cuisine.  Service standard is high.  Maybe we travelled at a low season, or more precisely, the COVID season. The occupancy rate is understandably low. The place looks immaculate and clean.","VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($̶3̶1̶) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94="

The rooms are really big and very well maintained with every bit of furniture that one can need. The staff is also very courteous and helpful. The one thing that was not too good was the wifi connectivity. It took ages to connect. Also, network speeds in the area are bad.    The only thing inconvenient about the place was its location. It is quite far from the beach road. The hotel does provide transfers to its guests, but it can be a little expensive. Since Pattaya does not have a proper metered taxi service in the city, we usually had no choice but to go for the one provided by the hotel.","VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($̶3̶1̶) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94="

Clairelou31 wrote a review Jan 2015,50,Stunning peaceful resort with very friendly & helpful staff,"My boyfriend and I stayed there for 2nights over New Year- the gardens are beautiful & the whole resort feels very relaxed!  Rooms were big, clean & spacious & the shower was amazing too!  The staff on reception were helpful & arranged taxis for us giving us good advice about prices etc  Food was good & very reasonably priced- no vodka available from the bar though which was a shame. Breakfast basic but enough to start your day!  It's a bit far out from the main party bars - around 20mins in a taxi costing 200-300baht.  Would def recommend to couples, families and those looking for a relaxing stay!","VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($̶3̶1̶) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94="
Heatwave wrote a review Mar 2014,40,Peaceful Resort,"I will start off by saying that this resort is truly beautiful. The vegetation is stunning giving the resort an extremely peaceful ambience. The staff are gracious and will do anything they can to help you. To this end l have never been to another resort where there are so many people employed to keep the resort looking so immaculate. There is really only one thing that I have concerns about (and this was highlighted by another reviewer) the breakfast food that should be served hot, is cold! Like the other reviewer also stated,the room service food is great and hot,so why are guests expected to eat the cold breakfast food? Several excuses were put forward about the cold breakfast food, not enough people, we open at 6,30am it is hot at that time of day. Hmmmm well sorry I am on holidays and I am not getting up at that time unless I need to catch a plane! This resort is great in almost every respect, but someone really needs to take the bull by the horns and deal with this issue of cold food. Resolve that Villa and in my opinion you have a first class resort.","VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($̶3̶1̶) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94="
Matt S wrote a review Nov 2013,10,"If you like rude staff and thumping music everywhere, this is the place for you.","We went for a short, relaxing break away from Bangkok. What we got, was far from that. We encountered surly, rude and poorly trained staff from the moment we arrived. We went to the pool, and shortly after our arrival we were joined by a number of obnoxious Thais and their loud sound system. Ok, each to their own, so we went to our room. Except, shortly after, the hotel's own sound system cranks up, and our walls and windows are vibrating with the overkill bass that is so loved out here.    The hotel's name - Villa Wanida Garden Resort - gives an impression of peace and tranquility; don't be fooled, and don't stay there.","VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($̶3̶1̶) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94="
James H wrote a review Sep 2013,20,"Beautiful gardens, friendly staff, management dont listen to complaints.","I have stayed at Villa Wanida twice this year, the first time I could not fault the place, the gardens are beautiful the pools are both excellent, the staff around the place do what ever they can to help you, but my second visit was not as good.  On my second day I complained that the breakfast was cold, the receptionist apologised and assured me it would not happen again, well on the 5 day I went for breakfast at 730am thinking the food would be hot, how wrong I was, now the staff asked if I wanted it reheated (No thanks its been uncovered for over an hour now), what is annoying is that when you pay for room service food here, it is excellent, so why don't they care about the breakfast ....  Also with this in mind, there is no microwave or cooker in the rooms just a kettle, so you cant simply heat a snack.  My other issue is the noise that some guests make from 7am onwards, this is not challenged by anyone here, I have noticed the resort here is expanding, its sad to see that when this happens the service tends to nose dive. Also charging 50 baht for an extra pillow is ridiculous but original ! ive never heard of that before.Must do better Villa Wanida, Im off to ride 5 km to get some breakfast.","VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($̶3̶1̶) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94="

Europaul33 wrote a review Aug 2013,50,Garden haven of tranquility and wonderful welcome,"Visited Villa Wanida in October 2012 where we were conducting some training. The staff were exemplary, catering for the fussy food habits of our children, and the hospitalisation of one of our group - with warmth and humour.    The facilities were fantastic, with two swimming pools, outdoor chess, bikes for the children. There was enough to see locally with shopping, restaurants, Elephant park and Tiger Zoo. Sad to see how Thailand has sold much of its beauty to creepy international travellers; but what a beautiful people and country.","VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($̶3̶1̶) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94="
jay s wrote a review Jul 2013,50,Beautiful Resort,Hi we stayed at this resort for 03 nights and wish we could stay for longer as it was so beautiful and calm.The break fast was very filling and varied.The pool was very clean and the kitchenette in room was an added bonus.The staff was very helpful and even arranged a foot massage for us at the pool area at 9 at night.  This place is ideal for families who want to stay a little away from the touristy Pattaya.  Tuk Tuk took 200 Baht to take us to the beach area and return by taxi cost us 300 Baht.,"VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($̶3̶1̶) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94="
zebukee wrote a review Jun 2013,40,"A traquil resort, lovely pool area, beautiful landscape","We stayed here while on a holiday to thailand. Its an amazing destination in itself if you are looking to relax away from the crowded cityscape. It has an amazing pool area, beautiful landscaped gardens.  The villa provided was fairly large with all amenities u will need. A well equipped kitchenette and a dining area will make u feel right at home.  Its a must visit for those who want to get away from city and seek peace and tranquility. On and they provide bicycles to move around in campus, which was a nice addition.  But its not for those who wish to be connected to major areas as this one is a bit far away from main areas of pattaya.","VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($̶3̶1̶) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94="

Ingo D wrote a review May 2013,40,"Nice, relaxed resort, far away from town","The resort is set in a lovely tropical garden environment. We booked the triple room with one kingsize and one smaller bed, ideal for a kid. The room was really spacious with balcony, kitchen area, a small dining table, plenty of closets and a large bath tub. The area is very quiet at night and we had a good sleep all through the late morning, thanks to the dark curtains and quiet air-condition. Only drawback were the soft mattresses, which we're not used to. But others may like it. The main swimming pool is also very nice and our son really loved it.  The food offered in the restaurant is generally OK, but the breakfast was a bit of a disappointment.  One word of caution: this place is very far from Pattaya city center and the next attractive beach, so if you don't have your own transport you're at the mercy of the local taxi operators...","VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($̶3̶1̶) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94="

BillyCarrsUK wrote a review Dec 2012,50,"Diamond in the rough, totally unexpected gem, world class resort.","We booked this online after reading a couple of reviews. When we were heading there no one knew where it was or had heard of it. We eventually found a sign pointing down a dirt track, we drove about 800 yards and it was looking worse and worse until we pulled into the drive of this Caribbean-esque self-contained resort!! The place was so beautiful, several staff were on duty to greet us and were tidying up single fallen leaves, the place was paradise! There are 2 pools to choose from, both as lovely as each other. The staff were amazing, the food in the restaurant was lovely, the breakfast was basic but quite a variety. The 2 rooms were had were situated in like a beach house looking building which had 2 separate front doors but an adjoining door inside which was handy for us lads using each others toiletries and having a few drinks together. I am 100% going back again. It cost me approx £13 per night per person.

JEU wrote a review Dec 2012,50,Stunning.... Would give 6* if possible!!,"What can I say about Villa Wanida other than the place is simply stunning?!?!    We stayed here on 11th December 2012 for 4 nights after arriving in Thailand the day before, and what a very pleasant shock we had when we arrived here!!!!    Firstly, on your way to the resort don't be put off by the long ""dirt track"" road which takes you down to Villa Wanida..... We all had horrible visions of what the place would be like but rest assured you're on your way to an oasis of beauty, luxury and tranquility!    Other people have already pointed out how lovely and peaceful it is but I should mention that yes it is a way from the main strip but the hotel organised taxi only cost us B400 (approx £8) to the town centre and that's for 6 people!! Trust me it's a great location, unless you want to [try to] sleep with loud music thumping through your room at 5am above a nightclub?!?! Thought not! :-)    The hotel staff are brilliant, speak good English and the food was also very very nice and very fresh. The breakfast was fine for us and included hot meats, eggs, toast, jams, cereal, fruit and juices!    I will certainly be coming back to stay here again, that's 100% a promise as I absolutely love this hotel and can't rate it high enough!

ThirstyTraveller28 wrote a review Aug 2012,50,Great Little Family Run Resort,"This resort is truly family owned and run. It is a little away from the center of Pattaya, and for a traveler with family, thank god for that    Designed and built by an ex banker, the resort is managed and run by him, his wife and daughter Feya.    For any resort at any price range this has got to be one of the best gardens and landscapes I have ever seen. And I have seen most of them all from Bill Bensley, Made Vijaya to Site Concepts etc. What makes it even more creditable is that he has no formal training in landscape design or architecture or interiors for that matter    Built in phases from money earned by building and selling villas nearby, this place is really peaceful and a super getaway for both Thais and foreigners looking for a quiet family oriented resort at Pattaya    The beaches in Pattaya are anyway not that great for swimming and water sport. You have to go to either Koh Larn or at least 30 min further south of Pattaya to find decent beaches    Please do not go to this resort with expectations of a high end resort and professional service. This is truly a family run place (with the owners wife not afraid to pick up and mop the place when needed as well as jump into her luxury sedan and head to the market to pick up some supplies    Feya the owners daughter is formally educated in Australia and we ended up turning to her most of the time for advise and help. She runs the FO and restaurant which by the way serves the best Thai food I have had so far in Thailand    The staff are NOT fluent in English but are fairly easy to communicate with, ever smiling and always happy to help. My daughter had the best part of her holiday here and she was really indulged in and cared for by Feya and her staff    2 lovely swimming pools, beautiful manicured gardens and lawns. We cannot not praise this place enough. They arranged for a nice taxi to take us around. But most of the time we were contented to just stay put, play giant chess, petanque or just chill out by the pool    The villa style rooms are massive with big comfortable beds, a little kitchenette, a nice bathroom and a verandah and also a small sit out at the back    They have plenty of cycles that you can use and you can even apparently rent a scooter to go around. Please be aware that you do require an international license and it is illegal to scoot around without a helmet on (despite what you see in Pattaya)    Once again a big thank you to Feya, your Mum and Dad and the rest of the Villa Wanida team...

Resamedsma wrote a review Nov 2011,50,"Large, quiet & quiet bungalows, beautiful gardens and extremely friendly staff. Good value for money.","We stayed for nine nights with three very small children and I have only good things to say. The gardens around the bungalows are beautiful and impeccably maintained, there are toys provided to play with in swimming pool, bicycles on loan (no charge), free wi-fi, and our kids were even offered horseback riding at 5pm daily (again at no charge). Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The only drawbacks may be (1) breakfast may not satisfy all, as it has the choice of American or three versions of rice/noodle dishes,  (2) the place is nowhere near the beach, as it is 500 m from main (Sukhumvit) road, and transport can take a long time in Pattaya. Thus not suitable for those who want to spend most days on the beach.","VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($̶3̶1̶) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94="
Kevin K wrote a review Sep 2011,40,Lovely little resort away from the noise of Pattaya,"Stayed here in July 2011 with my family.This resort is away from all the hustle and bustle of Pattaya , in beautiful garden surroundings.This is a family run business and the staff were very friendly and helpful.    The resort is fairly new. The rooms are beautiful and clean with a large bathroom.The beds some of the most comfortable I have slept in anywhere, a rarity for Thailand.    There is a lovely swimming pool suitable for children and adults alike.My children also used complementary bicycles to ride around the resort.    We only used the restaurant for breakfast, and this was my biggest complaint. There was a very limited selection of food. If you wanted Western food there was only eggs bacon and toast. No cereal and the fruit selection was pineapple and watermelon every day, and not always the best quality. The Orange juice was not fresh juice but appeared to be orange squash.    However the resort was so nice that the poor breakfast would not stop me returning. A word of caution though, we had our own transport so getting around was no problem but if you did not have transport the resort is well away from the main road and there is nothing else in the area. We actually liked this but it could be a problem if you wanted to get out and about and did not have transport.","VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($̶3̶1̶) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94="
Jolyon M wrote a review Feb 2011,40,Quiet and pretty resort with excellent room and value added,"Villa Wanida is just perfect for those seeking a quiet getaway but within 10 minutes drive from the very centre of Pattaya. It's a family run business and only 18 months old and the general upkeep is very high. Service is very good with friendly staff and the rooms are the most spacious I have ever come across in Thailand for the money. The smart decor and attention to detail in the rooms is significant. Facilities on site include a family size swimming pool, a small fitness room, a full size boules court, outdoor giant chess, darts and free use of bicycles for resort guests.  Stays over a week might drag unless one is totally into isolation as the resort is down a very quiet street without any buses or shops nearby, which in itself could be appealing to some or for those with their own transport.  Breakfast is average but considering it's included in a very competitive room rate, it's a steal with a buffet running when their are enough guests, otherwise it's ABF and rice soup with fruit 'style' a la carte.  If the resort owner would employ a complimentary shuttle vehicle service to downtown and back a few times a day I'm sure the place would double it's visitor traffic.  Bring your own LAN cable as the resort's (provided) is just one metre short. Internet is complimentary but it's a hastle changing from LAN in the rooms to wifi by by the pool with the passwords the reception hands out, but the connection is fast enough and completely free! How bad is that!  The food in the restaurant is pretty good, a reasonable price and there are no plus plus taxes which is an added bonus. An ice cream cone is only 20b!","VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($̶3̶1̶) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94="
