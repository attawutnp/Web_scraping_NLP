Robert 'Pete' Parsons wrote a review Sep 2017,10,Going Down The Hill,"Stayed at the Honey Lodge many times. This time, Saturday, August 9, 2017. Check in without reservations is a breeze. Stayed many times and always seemed like a very clean, quite, and secure location. This time had to change rooms, without incident upon stepping into the room. Smelled like someone stayed there that detested personal hygiene, as in the male type. No, problem got another room. This room was totally sub-par from anything there, room 220 on second floor. The AC continuously cut off during the night. The room was not stocked with its usual sundry of items. I will not stay there again. Again, this is usually the place to stay. The wifi is not free, 150 THB per day. If they would take a little more pride in the place it would get me back.","HONEY LODGE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.934711,100.892021&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.934711,100.892021&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.934132,100.887672|12.934503,100.891907|12.937825,100.892319|12.934280,100.891502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.934425,100.893944|12.935964,100.888329|12.934770,100.890045|12.931151,100.890053|12.935006,100.891457|12.934615,100.890152|12.935438,100.890152|12.934950,100.891464|12.936825,100.893097&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.938590,100.890793|12.938218,100.891045|12.932687,100.895325|12.937084,100.890457|12.937399,100.891861|12.933731,100.888527|12.938361,100.892754|12.934778,100.888260|12.934186,100.888176&signature=xzKDthfOfjmU00EQIjZ2Z2eib1w="

Book direct and it's about 300 Baht cheaper.","HONEY LODGE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.934711,100.892021&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.934711,100.892021&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.934132,100.887672|12.934503,100.891907|12.937825,100.892319|12.934280,100.891502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.934425,100.893944|12.935964,100.888329|12.934770,100.890045|12.931151,100.890053|12.935006,100.891457|12.934615,100.890152|12.935438,100.890152|12.934950,100.891464|12.936825,100.893097&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.938590,100.890793|12.938218,100.891045|12.932687,100.895325|12.937084,100.890457|12.937399,100.891861|12.933731,100.888527|12.938361,100.892754|12.934778,100.888260|12.934186,100.888176&signature=xzKDthfOfjmU00EQIjZ2Z2eib1w="
domtheone wrote a review Apr 2017,30,Very average. Good location,"Reception not the friendliest i've encountered. Very mechanical and cold.    Room was boiling hot when i arrived. Air con on. Fine. 2 hours later, spotted ants around the sink. No big deal since i was only there 1 night. Soon after, a huge cockroach appeared around the back of the sink. Quite a game of cat and mouse before it finally departed down the shower drain!    The bed was very firm too.    If you're wanting to be close to Walking street though, this is a great location.

How about you take that 50 Baht a day you collect for wifi and provide a toothbrush and shampoo that will cost you 20 Baht... Overall, I would stay here again.

Just on the beach road somewhere. WiFI is good in room, you do have to pay 50 baht, like $1 us which is nothing.  staff was nice and pleasant.

Jon L wrote a review Mar 2016,40,Tucked away just near walking street.,"Good clean hotel, tucked away in an alley right at the end of Walking Street. Close to the beach. Good value too and the staff are pretty good. Handy safety boxes outside reception and friendly hotel cats (not strays) appreciate some cat treats here and there haha.    It was my second time there and was pretty much the same as before. Clean but in need of a little TLC here and there. Nothing to worry about though. The toilet cistern in my room (319) needed a new float thing inside so unless you open up the top and pull it up, it will just keep filling and filling and driving you crazy with the sound haha. The shower is a little crazy too with one enormous head and a little one. I couldn't work out for the life of me how to get the big one working!    I intend to stay here again on return visits to Pattaya. The location is so convenient and frankly in Pattaya there are some nasty hotels so it was a relief to find this one last year.","HONEY LODGE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.934711,100.892021&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.934711,100.892021&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.934132,100.887672|12.934503,100.891907|12.937825,100.892319|12.934280,100.891502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.934425,100.893944|12.935964,100.888329|12.934770,100.890045|12.931151,100.890053|12.935006,100.891457|12.934615,100.890152|12.935438,100.890152|12.934950,100.891464|12.936825,100.893097&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.938590,100.890793|12.938218,100.891045|12.932687,100.895325|12.937084,100.890457|12.937399,100.891861|12.933731,100.888527|12.938361,100.892754|12.934778,100.888260|12.934186,100.888176&signature=xzKDthfOfjmU00EQIjZ2Z2eib1w="

Baz W wrote a review Jan 2014,40,A hidden gem close to walking Street,2 friends and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found it very good for the price.  Its located up a little dead end street just around the corner from the entrance to walking street.  They have a very nice pool and that is a real bonus for a hotel with modestly priced rooms in a good location.  Since its tucked a bit away from the main traffic and pedestrian area its very quiet and there's no problem getting a good nights sleep.  It looks like the whole hotel has recently had a makeover as the rooms are fresh and clean and the bathrooms look new and very modern with rain maker style showers and a shower cubicle with a glass door  If your looking for a reasonably priced hotel with a pool in a good location close to walking street then this place is a good choice.  If there was one downside it would be the staff and service as it was just average without being great but I am getting picky now as overall it was very good value for money.,"HONEY LODGE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.934711,100.892021&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.934711,100.892021&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.934132,100.887672|12.934503,100.891907|12.937825,100.892319|12.934280,100.891502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.934425,100.893944|12.935964,100.888329|12.934770,100.890045|12.931151,100.890053|12.935006,100.891457|12.934615,100.890152|12.935438,100.890152|12.934950,100.891464|12.936825,100.893097&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.938590,100.890793|12.938218,100.891045|12.932687,100.895325|12.937084,100.890457|12.937399,100.891861|12.933731,100.888527|12.938361,100.892754|12.934778,100.888260|12.934186,100.888176&signature=xzKDthfOfjmU00EQIjZ2Z2eib1w="
Mr_Allsop wrote a review Dec 2013,40,Good modern hotel. Excellent location. Great value.,"I have stayed there three times. Attractive modern building tucked away in a quiet courtyard, very close to Walking Street. Spacious reception area and corridors. Clean modern room with good aircon, hot water and wi-fi (small daily charge). Did not try the breakfast (looked a bit basic) but there are plenty of good cheap cafes and bars nearby. Lift, outdoor pool, English-speaking staff. A very good hotel by any standard and excellent value at £18 a night. I arrived without a booking and there were plenty of free rooms - even though the main internet booking sites said not. The same happened on all three of my visits.

SteveJ617 wrote a review Apr 2013,10,Had my credit card details copied by the lady at reception,"Scammers at this hotel reception. Stay away from this place.  I recently stayed at the honey lodge  address 597/8 Moo 10 Nongprue Banglamung, Chonburi 20150.    On the 28 march I handed my credit card to the lady behind the counter to pay for my extra night stay at the hotel. I watched her place the card in a credit card type reader then look at her computer. She then said ""must waiting"" I said ""ok"". Two to three minutes later she said ""still waiting you come back later leave card"". This to me was very suspicious behaviour that she would ask me to leave my credit card with her. I said no and asked for the card back. My credit card had been in this reader device the whole time about two to three minutes. On 29 march around 10am I logged onto net banking and noticed unusual transactions on my credit card I notified the bank immediately and they confirmed that the card had been compromised to the value of around $5000 AUD.  This is the only time I attempted to use the card the whole trip and the only opportunity for someone to copy my card information. I believe that the lady behind reception is coping people's credit card details then returning the card to the owner without a record of a transaction. The bank would have no record of a transaction at the honey hotel yet she has a copy of the card details.","HONEY LODGE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.934711,100.892021&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.934711,100.892021&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.934132,100.887672|12.934503,100.891907|12.937825,100.892319|12.934280,100.891502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.934425,100.893944|12.935964,100.888329|12.934770,100.890045|12.931151,100.890053|12.935006,100.891457|12.934615,100.890152|12.935438,100.890152|12.934950,100.891464|12.936825,100.893097&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.938590,100.890793|12.938218,100.891045|12.932687,100.895325|12.937084,100.890457|12.937399,100.891861|12.933731,100.888527|12.938361,100.892754|12.934778,100.888260|12.934186,100.888176&signature=xzKDthfOfjmU00EQIjZ2Z2eib1w="
Madjid A wrote a review Feb 2013,40,"Great Value, New with a modern flair, Clean Hotel with a great Location and a small Poll",A few steps to Walking Street and a major Pattaya intersetion yet surprinsingly quiet. Rooms are rather small and the bed is barely enough for two (but for one it is plenty enough). However some have partial sea view and a balcony. Excellent value if you are not looking for great comfort. The small pool is a welcome sight and may even be usable.,"HONEY LODGE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.934711,100.892021&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.934711,100.892021&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.934132,100.887672|12.934503,100.891907|12.937825,100.892319|12.934280,100.891502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.934425,100.893944|12.935964,100.888329|12.934770,100.890045|12.931151,100.890053|12.935006,100.891457|12.934615,100.890152|12.935438,100.890152|12.934950,100.891464|12.936825,100.893097&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.938590,100.890793|12.938218,100.891045|12.932687,100.895325|12.937084,100.890457|12.937399,100.891861|12.933731,100.888527|12.938361,100.892754|12.934778,100.888260|12.934186,100.888176&signature=xzKDthfOfjmU00EQIjZ2Z2eib1w="
Chang Noi wrote a review Jan 2013,30,"Small, recently renovated hotel near Walkingstreet","Within 2min walking from Walkingstreet and beach road. And smaller hotel that has just been renovated. Actually good value for money. Too bad that they did not put in new towels and bed.    They have a small swimming pool. For the walking-in price I paid breakfast was not included (although I think they did not tell me that at check-in). Never the less, the 100thb for the continental breakfast is a waste of money. Better get an good breakfast somewhere else.    Otherwise the rooms is good, clean and comfortable.","HONEY LODGE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.934711,100.892021&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.934711,100.892021&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.934132,100.887672|12.934503,100.891907|12.937825,100.892319|12.934280,100.891502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.934425,100.893944|12.935964,100.888329|12.934770,100.890045|12.931151,100.890053|12.935006,100.891457|12.934615,100.890152|12.935438,100.890152|12.934950,100.891464|12.936825,100.893097&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.938590,100.890793|12.938218,100.891045|12.932687,100.895325|12.937084,100.890457|12.937399,100.891861|12.933731,100.888527|12.938361,100.892754|12.934778,100.888260|12.934186,100.888176&signature=xzKDthfOfjmU00EQIjZ2Z2eib1w="

I've been many times in Pattaya and stayed in different places.This one is my favorite.It costs 900baht per night and for such a room+pool is great price,especially if you compare with similar price hotels.

Walking distance to Walking Street where all the bar is, and jetty to another nearby island for BHT 15, remember to bring water and some food to eat or you will have to pay extra price for everything on the island (good far 1 lazy day trip), taxi to Survarnabumi airport at BHT 800 or you can take the shuttle van just front of the hotel to Monument MRT for BHT 100, take another MRT for another station for BHT 15 which will connect you to Airport MRT for BHT 45. Not so hassle but very cheap. Out of the entrance on the left walk straight about 100 meters you will find a big temple and an interesting market with lot of local foods and cheap too.
