Coffee Chill wrote a review Sep 2020,50,"Budget, location and service friendly digs.","'Z BY ZING', is an honest place to stay, most particularly for the budget and location conscious, tourist spending time in lovely Jomtien Beach. I really enjoyed the flexible attitude to reasonable service requests, as well as the quiet acoustics and expanded space, in my studio room. It is an easy, flat, five (5) minute walk to the beach, with heaps of; dining, drinking, entertainment, shopping and spa places (see my YouTube), occupying the surrounds.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

Kim K wrote a review Nov 2018,10,Pictures LIE !!,This hotel is a dive i wouldnt stay here if i got paid i booked this hotel from reading review since my inlaws needed a place to stay for a few days while my wife and i stayed at another hotel close by. They got a room on the roof yes on the roof apparently they had taken down the roof and build extra rooms up there AC could not cool the room the wall was thinner than a pancake and it had a smell of paint that made you feel dizzy. The location is also bad its in an ally with bad lighting just the place where you expect to get robbed or worse. When we confronted the receptionist she said this kind of hotel is not one you book in advance or even for a longer period its from ppl walking in from the street wanting to stay one night ( Like the sort of place you would take a prostiture i imagine maybe thats why it get good reviews ? ) anyway we got our money back and found another hotel.,"Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

The rooms are reasonably priced, basic but very clean and comfortable. The staff are friendly and it is about a 5 minute walk down to the beach. It is quite far south in Jomtien, however, you can get the Songthaew / Baht bus for 10 baht anywhere in Jomtien. Plenty of dining options nearby and also down on the seafront.    On my last visit I did have a number of problems with the Wifi. On previous visits, the wifi worked well but on quite a few occasions I could not get online. I would suggest they try to fix this.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="
phayaoThailand wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Very good value for your money,"I booked two rooms in this hotel through booking.com after reading the reviews in tripadvisor.com and I was not disappointed. The place is modern, clean and convenient for the beach and -most of all- very cheap. After a week there, we decided to stay 10 days more. The rooms are big, the wifi excellent, the aircon. the tv, the bathroom, the safe, the fridge, everything was perfect. the only draw back is that it is at the end of Jomtien soi 12 and you need to walk 5' to reach the main road or the beach. There is no breakfast or coffee shop, but they have a coffee machine at the lobby working free every morning: basic but very good place. Although the rooms are all non-smoking (which is good), they have a couple of tables at the porch where you can have a cup of coffee smoking a fag. Simple, basic, clean, convenient and very cheap: we paid an average of $15 per room per day.

jaslilydunn wrote a review Aug 2017,50,OUTSTANDING,"We stayed here for 4 days, first night my bed wasn't to comfortable so I spoke to reception and within 10 minute they put a mattress topper on. This made the bed outstanding. The hotel is super clean, the cleaners are very friendly. The pools are clean, top deck pool is pretty over looking the city. One thing I didn't like is the Indians were all swimming in there pants, and this does really annoy me cause it's just the dirtiest of things. Maybe staff could tell me shorts need to be worn. Apart from that could not fault a single thing we loved our stay, and this place is worth more then what they charge, we paid 2,700 for 4 days. Very very cheap but great place.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="
Chris V wrote a review Jul 2017,30,Nothing exceptional....,"Did arrived there around 3pm there, room was ready.  Check in went quite ok without real greetings as well any welcome amenities as a simple glass of juice or fresh water. No information provided about the room and property.  Room 401 is quite ok, big enough for 2 persons but not really well cleaned. Food or brownish stains on white walls in the room as well plenty of toothpaste spots around the sink in the bathroom, sliding room is a kind of mouldy/rusty and doesn't give a good impression about hygiene. Good water pressure as well hot water was ok enough. Limited foreigner TV channels, small fried, safety deposit box locked, asked to open it but never happened...  Plenty of plugs around the room, wifi was ok and not always stable....  In conclusion nothing extraordinary or to make it wow.  Pictures are better than the reality...  Few long Asian lady hair on the floor closed to the bed too who is a big turn off for me without being picky....","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

BrianF10 wrote a review Jan 2017,50,You get what you pay for.,"The room is big enough, clean and tidy.    It's located about 500m from Jomtien Beach Road and is very quiet. Nothing close by to cause too much noise.    There is complimentary coffee in reception and tea (40 baht), not sure if you have to pay for the toast. It would be awesome if they could provide filter coffee.    This is a budget hotel and the location bears this out. There doesn't appear to be any rooms with a view. The reception front is opposite a car park. My room has the view of the side of another hotel. Not the type hotel where you can laze around if you didn't want to go sight-seeing.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

I'd say pretty also, but that's taste. Coffee available all the time. Guess it depends on what you like, so people who complain it's not near the crowded downtown glitzy part of Pattaya are right. But me and my lady friend (we're a 50's and 60's age group) just loved it. A five minute or less walk to very nice beach, quiet at the end of deserted street for us was fine. Wonderful inexpensive delicious restaurant right around the corner. Incredibly inexpensive, well run, not fancy, but what do you need for a romantic little vacation besides a beautiful beach with hawkers offering you fresh pineapple and mangoes every few minutes for a pittance, and a quiet safe room.

sinhasaurabh014 wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Good clean budget place,"writing the review a year later but per latest reviews, it still seems relavant.  stayed here in July 2015.    This is a very clean place. The rooms are clean, the bedding is good, the toilets and shower is good. Also it costs around 500THB that is super cool. Free wifi. No in-house kitchen.    This hotel is on the quieter Jomtien beach area and hence far from all actions.But you can always -any time- walk to the main road and take a shared tempo-songtaew- and reach anywhere in just 10THB per head.    Jomtien beach is just 2 mins walk...so you can take stroll or just sit on the beaches in the night.    Overall, a very good place to stay and well within budget. (but if your are a gang of boys willing to spend to stay closer to walking street...then dont choose jomtien beach area...or this hotel)    No views from your window unless you take the topmost floor.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="
mk_steven_r wrote a review Jun 2016,30,The location turned me off!,"Stay here on my recent visit to pattaya, i found this property on booking.com on 8.0 rating, therefore i thought this would be a good choice, but it turn out to be the opposite for me.    Here's the pros of the hotel:  1. It's cheap, it cost much cheaper than any other hotel in pattaya.  2. It's clean, yes i say its clean. The rooms are well kept, no stains on bedsheets or toilets.  3. The Shower is good. The water rush on these showers are really good!  4. Wifi is super fast! I was happy with it!  5. This place is quite, away from the clubs and bars, at night it can be very deserted.    Here's the cons, as per my review. If you are a party goers, looking for entertainment then it's a big no for you! Here's why i said so:  1. The Location! It's way too far from the central pattaya or walking street! These part of pattaya (jomtien) is a bit laidback, thr's not much entertainment here and everytime you wnt to go to walking street 'sontheaw' ride cost between 150bt to 200bt. So you still lose the money you save on the hotel rate!  2. The surrounding is no good. This part of the town is on construction site, or these buildings are abandoned! So i can get abit frightening at night. But no problems, just that its on deserted place.  3. The rooms has rules, they will charge you not only for damage but also for dirty! Therefore if you stay here, then you got to be very very careful with their stuff.  4. Door has Gaps! Doors when closed has got gaps in between, if there's anyone whom tried to peep, i believe they can see!    I would not come here back, simply because of the location. Rather pay abit more and stay in places near central pattaya.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

Ken M wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Hotel is kept extremely clean at all times.,"This place is a little off the beaten path which can be both good and bad. The bad is that you are away from all the 'action' in the Jomtien/Pattaya area which can be good on it's own, and the good part is that if you want a nice quiet place to be that is super reasonable then you have found it. It's about the equivalent of 2-3 blocks from the beach so it's just a short stroll to get there. Or take a passing songtow and head off to the Night Market or Rampoo market for some great street food for next to nothing. While the rooms can seem a little sparse from Western standards and there really isn't any view from the rooms, this isn't where I spent my waking hours. Good place to just come back to and get cleaned up so you can head back out and get some food (and maybe a beer).","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

The first thing you notice about the room is how big it is. It's massive.

Its got a ""white"" theme going on with a ton of lights in the ceiling that amplify the rooms whiteness when turned on. Its just not my cup of tea. You wont get that romantic golden glow here. But the price is low, its clean and appears safe.

Go2Look wrote a review Mar 2016,30,Ok but still not good!,"Z by Zing is hidden in the end of a blind ally with hostels and industry as neighbours. It's not a nice neighbourhood but it also means you are a distance from the noisy cars in the busy street.  My room was clean but very impersonal. Not a cosy room. The doors had really big openings around it and it was tried fixed with rubber bands but without mentionable success! I could look out into the hallway. Both light and noise came through easily at night.  Staff was polite and helpful. But the shower was fantastic! Loads of water and as hot as you wanted it from the large shower head.  The beach is not very far away but I never went to stay there.  Along the busy street there are lots of sale booths. Everything from fresh fruit, street food, travel agencies and various souvenirs.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

Abby C wrote a review Jan 2016,50,"Great stay, only minor improvements needed","We were really pleasantly surprised when we arrived at this hotel. We booked a superior double room for two weeks over Christmas & new year, and could happily have stayed longer. The location is perfect; right near the beach and still set back from the noise of the main road. 10 baht buses will run you anywhere in the area from this main road. Everything in the room worked and nothing leaked, which was a real difference from the other places we've stayed in Thailand. Inside the room was spotless, but the balcony was constantly grubby. It was quiet at night, but we were woken early most mornings by the building work next door, which we disappointingly hadn't been forewarned about. Building started around 7:30am most mornings and was hard to sleep through in our room, but maybe some rooms are quieter than others. They sell tea, coffee and toast in the foyer, and there is a 30 baht washing machine right outside the hotel if their laundry prices are a little pricey for you (like they were for us). The staff were not that brilliant, but not in any way rude; I think they were maybe just shy as their English was a little limited. Everyone apart from the manager just seemed to ignore us completely, unless we approached them first. Aircon and WiFi worked well. The bed was hard but no worse than the rest of Thailand. I highly recommend this hotel!","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

Matthew-MY wrote a review Nov 2015,20,Basic,"Basic budget hotel. Rooms are undoubtedly big and everything else is very basic.Can't expect much with such pricing. The hotel however expect a deposit of 1000 bath upon check in.    Room: The room does have a safe but the size is about 6 X 4 inches so it is not very useful. The room doors are still using the conventional type of locking system so it is rather easy to prise open which made me feel rather insecure. There were on going construction work going on outside so by 9am I was totally awake by the natural alarm clock.    Staff: The staff, they are not very well versed in almost everything because whatever I ask I only got a yes, no or I don't know answer.    Location: The hotel location is really hard to find even for the locals so had to use another hotel as a landmark for cabs. The vicinity of the hotel don't really serve much food however if anyone is willing to walk about 500m there are some food stalls outside.    Wifi: the hotel provide encrypted wifi and the stability was ok.    Conclusion: This hotel has nothing to shout about but well for a budget hotel I guess it'll suffice.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

Kim K wrote a review Nov 2018,10,Pictures LIE !!,This hotel is a dive i wouldnt stay here if i got paid i booked this hotel from reading review since my inlaws needed a place to stay for a few days while my wife and i stayed at another hotel close by. They got a room on the roof yes on the roof apparently they had taken down the roof and build extra rooms up there AC could not cool the room the wall was thinner than a pancake and it had a smell of paint that made you feel dizzy. The location is also bad its in an ally with bad lighting just the place where you expect to get robbed or worse. When we confronted the receptionist she said this kind of hotel is not one you book in advance or even for a longer period its from ppl walking in from the street wanting to stay one night ( Like the sort of place you would take a prostiture i imagine maybe thats why it get good reviews ? ) anyway we got our money back and found another hotel.,"Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

phayaoThailand wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Very good value for your money,"I booked two rooms in this hotel through booking.com after reading the reviews in tripadvisor.com and I was not disappointed. The place is modern, clean and convenient for the beach and -most of all- very cheap. After a week there, we decided to stay 10 days more. The rooms are big, the wifi excellent, the aircon. the tv, the bathroom, the safe, the fridge, everything was perfect. the only draw back is that it is at the end of Jomtien soi 12 and you need to walk 5' to reach the main road or the beach. There is no breakfast or coffee shop, but they have a coffee machine at the lobby working free every morning: basic but very good place. Although the rooms are all non-smoking (which is good), they have a couple of tables at the porch where you can have a cup of coffee smoking a fag. Simple, basic, clean, convenient and very cheap: we paid an average of $15 per room per day.

jaslilydunn wrote a review Aug 2017,50,OUTSTANDING,"We stayed here for 4 days, first night my bed wasn't to comfortable so I spoke to reception and within 10 minute they put a mattress topper on. This made the bed outstanding. The hotel is super clean, the cleaners are very friendly. The pools are clean, top deck pool is pretty over looking the city. One thing I didn't like is the Indians were all swimming in there pants, and this does really annoy me cause it's just the dirtiest of things. Maybe staff could tell me shorts need to be worn. Apart from that could not fault a single thing we loved our stay, and this place is worth more then what they charge, we paid 2,700 for 4 days. Very very cheap but great place.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="
Chris V wrote a review Jul 2017,30,Nothing exceptional....,"Did arrived there around 3pm there, room was ready.  Check in went quite ok without real greetings as well any welcome amenities as a simple glass of juice or fresh water. No information provided about the room and property.  Room 401 is quite ok, big enough for 2 persons but not really well cleaned. Food or brownish stains on white walls in the room as well plenty of toothpaste spots around the sink in the bathroom, sliding room is a kind of mouldy/rusty and doesn't give a good impression about hygiene. Good water pressure as well hot water was ok enough. Limited foreigner TV channels, small fried, safety deposit box locked, asked to open it but never happened...  Plenty of plugs around the room, wifi was ok and not always stable....  In conclusion nothing extraordinary or to make it wow.  Pictures are better than the reality...  Few long Asian lady hair on the floor closed to the bed too who is a big turn off for me without being picky....","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

BrianF10 wrote a review Jan 2017,50,You get what you pay for.,"The room is big enough, clean and tidy.    It's located about 500m from Jomtien Beach Road and is very quiet. Nothing close by to cause too much noise.    There is complimentary coffee in reception and tea (40 baht), not sure if you have to pay for the toast. It would be awesome if they could provide filter coffee.    This is a budget hotel and the location bears this out. There doesn't appear to be any rooms with a view. The reception front is opposite a car park. My room has the view of the side of another hotel. Not the type hotel where you can laze around if you didn't want to go sight-seeing.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

neilturetsky wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Great little budget hotel in Pattaya for couple,"Young staff, very nice people, great price, super clean room, excellent bed, small to medium size room. I'd say pretty also, but that's taste. Coffee available all the time. Guess it depends on what you like, so people who complain it's not near the crowded downtown glitzy part of Pattaya are right. But me and my lady friend (we're a 50's and 60's age group) just loved it. A five minute or less walk to very nice beach, quiet at the end of deserted street for us was fine. Wonderful inexpensive delicious restaurant right around the corner. Incredibly inexpensive, well run, not fancy, but what do you need for a romantic little vacation besides a beautiful beach with hawkers offering you fresh pineapple and mangoes every few minutes for a pittance, and a quiet safe room. And a great name to remember, Z by Zing, my friend and I laugh about it when we think of it!","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

The noise is very terrible and make us leave the room as soon as possible.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="
sinhasaurabh014 wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Good clean budget place,"writing the review a year later but per latest reviews, it still seems relavant.  stayed here in July 2015.    This is a very clean place. The rooms are clean, the bedding is good, the toilets and shower is good. Also it costs around 500THB that is super cool. Free wifi. No in-house kitchen.    This hotel is on the quieter Jomtien beach area and hence far from all actions.But you can always -any time- walk to the main road and take a shared tempo-songtaew- and reach anywhere in just 10THB per head.    Jomtien beach is just 2 mins walk...so you can take stroll or just sit on the beaches in the night.    Overall, a very good place to stay and well within budget. (but if your are a gang of boys willing to spend to stay closer to walking street...then dont choose jomtien beach area...or this hotel)    No views from your window unless you take the topmost floor.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="
mk_steven_r wrote a review Jun 2016,30,The location turned me off!,"Stay here on my recent visit to pattaya, i found this property on booking.com on 8.0 rating, therefore i thought this would be a good choice, but it turn out to be the opposite for me.    Here's the pros of the hotel:  1. It's cheap, it cost much cheaper than any other hotel in pattaya.  2. It's clean, yes i say its clean. The rooms are well kept, no stains on bedsheets or toilets.  3. The Shower is good. The water rush on these showers are really good!  4. Wifi is super fast! I was happy with it!  5. This place is quite, away from the clubs and bars, at night it can be very deserted.    Here's the cons, as per my review. If you are a party goers, looking for entertainment then it's a big no for you! Here's why i said so:  1. The Location! It's way too far from the central pattaya or walking street! These part of pattaya (jomtien) is a bit laidback, thr's not much entertainment here and everytime you wnt to go to walking street 'sontheaw' ride cost between 150bt to 200bt. So you still lose the money you save on the hotel rate!  2. The surrounding is no good. This part of the town is on construction site, or these buildings are abandoned! So i can get abit frightening at night. But no problems, just that its on deserted place.  3. The rooms has rules, they will charge you not only for damage but also for dirty! Therefore if you stay here, then you got to be very very careful with their stuff.  4. Door has Gaps! Doors when closed has got gaps in between, if there's anyone whom tried to peep, i believe they can see!    I would not come here back, simply because of the location. Rather pay abit more and stay in places near central pattaya.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

Ken M wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Hotel is kept extremely clean at all times.,"This place is a little off the beaten path which can be both good and bad. The bad is that you are away from all the 'action' in the Jomtien/Pattaya area which can be good on it's own, and the good part is that if you want a nice quiet place to be that is super reasonable then you have found it. It's about the equivalent of 2-3 blocks from the beach so it's just a short stroll to get there. Or take a passing songtow and head off to the Night Market or Rampoo market for some great street food for next to nothing. While the rooms can seem a little sparse from Western standards and there really isn't any view from the rooms, this isn't where I spent my waking hours. Good place to just come back to and get cleaned up so you can head back out and get some food (and maybe a beer).","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

It's not a nice neighbourhood but it also means you are a distance from the noisy cars in the busy street.  My room was clean but very impersonal. Not a cosy room. The doors had really big openings around it and it was tried fixed with rubber bands but without mentionable success! I could look out into the hallway. Both light and noise came through easily at night.  Staff was polite and helpful. But the shower was fantastic! Loads of water and as hot as you wanted it from the large shower head.

Abby C wrote a review Jan 2016,50,"Great stay, only minor improvements needed","We were really pleasantly surprised when we arrived at this hotel. We booked a superior double room for two weeks over Christmas & new year, and could happily have stayed longer. The location is perfect; right near the beach and still set back from the noise of the main road. 10 baht buses will run you anywhere in the area from this main road. Everything in the room worked and nothing leaked, which was a real difference from the other places we've stayed in Thailand. Inside the room was spotless, but the balcony was constantly grubby. It was quiet at night, but we were woken early most mornings by the building work next door, which we disappointingly hadn't been forewarned about. Building started around 7:30am most mornings and was hard to sleep through in our room, but maybe some rooms are quieter than others. They sell tea, coffee and toast in the foyer, and there is a 30 baht washing machine right outside the hotel if their laundry prices are a little pricey for you (like they were for us). The staff were not that brilliant, but not in any way rude; I think they were maybe just shy as their English was a little limited. Everyone apart from the manager just seemed to ignore us completely, unless we approached them first. Aircon and WiFi worked well. The bed was hard but no worse than the rest of Thailand. I highly recommend this hotel!","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

Matthew-MY wrote a review Nov 2015,20,Basic,"Basic budget hotel. Rooms are undoubtedly big and everything else is very basic.Can't expect much with such pricing. The hotel however expect a deposit of 1000 bath upon check in.    Room: The room does have a safe but the size is about 6 X 4 inches so it is not very useful. The room doors are still using the conventional type of locking system so it is rather easy to prise open which made me feel rather insecure. There were on going construction work going on outside so by 9am I was totally awake by the natural alarm clock.    Staff: The staff, they are not very well versed in almost everything because whatever I ask I only got a yes, no or I don't know answer.    Location: The hotel location is really hard to find even for the locals so had to use another hotel as a landmark for cabs. The vicinity of the hotel don't really serve much food however if anyone is willing to walk about 500m there are some food stalls outside.    Wifi: the hotel provide encrypted wifi and the stability was ok.    Conclusion: This hotel has nothing to shout about but well for a budget hotel I guess it'll suffice.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

This Hotel has to grow ofcourse but it is very clean - very chaep and 40 meters from the sea. So ideal for backpackers and the people with a small wallet .

Kim K wrote a review Nov 2018,10,Pictures LIE !!,This hotel is a dive i wouldnt stay here if i got paid i booked this hotel from reading review since my inlaws needed a place to stay for a few days while my wife and i stayed at another hotel close by. They got a room on the roof yes on the roof apparently they had taken down the roof and build extra rooms up there AC could not cool the room the wall was thinner than a pancake and it had a smell of paint that made you feel dizzy. The location is also bad its in an ally with bad lighting just the place where you expect to get robbed or worse. When we confronted the receptionist she said this kind of hotel is not one you book in advance or even for a longer period its from ppl walking in from the street wanting to stay one night ( Like the sort of place you would take a prostiture i imagine maybe thats why it get good reviews ? ) anyway we got our money back and found another hotel.,"Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

phayaoThailand wrote a review Nov 2017,40,Very good value for your money,"I booked two rooms in this hotel through booking.com after reading the reviews in tripadvisor.com and I was not disappointed. The place is modern, clean and convenient for the beach and -most of all- very cheap. After a week there, we decided to stay 10 days more. The rooms are big, the wifi excellent, the aircon. the tv, the bathroom, the safe, the fridge, everything was perfect. the only draw back is that it is at the end of Jomtien soi 12 and you need to walk 5' to reach the main road or the beach. There is no breakfast or coffee shop, but they have a coffee machine at the lobby working free every morning: basic but very good place. Although the rooms are all non-smoking (which is good), they have a couple of tables at the porch where you can have a cup of coffee smoking a fag. Simple, basic, clean, convenient and very cheap: we paid an average of $15 per room per day.

This made the bed outstanding. The hotel is super clean, the cleaners are very friendly. The pools are clean, top deck pool is pretty over looking the city. One thing I didn't like is the Indians were all swimming in there pants, and this does really annoy me cause it's just the dirtiest of things. Maybe staff could tell me shorts need to be worn. Apart from that could not fault a single thing we loved our stay, and this place is worth more then what they charge, we paid 2,700 for 4 days.

It would be awesome if they could provide filter coffee.    This is a budget hotel and the location bears this out. There doesn't appear to be any rooms with a view.

neilturetsky wrote a review Aug 2016,50,Great little budget hotel in Pattaya for couple,"Young staff, very nice people, great price, super clean room, excellent bed, small to medium size room. I'd say pretty also, but that's taste. Coffee available all the time. Guess it depends on what you like, so people who complain it's not near the crowded downtown glitzy part of Pattaya are right. But me and my lady friend (we're a 50's and 60's age group) just loved it. A five minute or less walk to very nice beach, quiet at the end of deserted street for us was fine. Wonderful inexpensive delicious restaurant right around the corner. Incredibly inexpensive, well run, not fancy, but what do you need for a romantic little vacation besides a beautiful beach with hawkers offering you fresh pineapple and mangoes every few minutes for a pittance, and a quiet safe room. And a great name to remember, Z by Zing, my friend and I laugh about it when we think of it!","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

sinhasaurabh014 wrote a review Jun 2016,40,Good clean budget place,"writing the review a year later but per latest reviews, it still seems relavant.  stayed here in July 2015.    This is a very clean place. The rooms are clean, the bedding is good, the toilets and shower is good. Also it costs around 500THB that is super cool. Free wifi. No in-house kitchen.    This hotel is on the quieter Jomtien beach area and hence far from all actions.But you can always -any time- walk to the main road and take a shared tempo-songtaew- and reach anywhere in just 10THB per head.    Jomtien beach is just 2 mins walk...so you can take stroll or just sit on the beaches in the night.    Overall, a very good place to stay and well within budget. (but if your are a gang of boys willing to spend to stay closer to walking street...then dont choose jomtien beach area...or this hotel)    No views from your window unless you take the topmost floor.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="
mk_steven_r wrote a review Jun 2016,30,The location turned me off!,"Stay here on my recent visit to pattaya, i found this property on booking.com on 8.0 rating, therefore i thought this would be a good choice, but it turn out to be the opposite for me.    Here's the pros of the hotel:  1. It's cheap, it cost much cheaper than any other hotel in pattaya.  2. It's clean, yes i say its clean. The rooms are well kept, no stains on bedsheets or toilets.  3. The Shower is good. The water rush on these showers are really good!  4. Wifi is super fast! I was happy with it!  5. This place is quite, away from the clubs and bars, at night it can be very deserted.    Here's the cons, as per my review. If you are a party goers, looking for entertainment then it's a big no for you! Here's why i said so:  1. The Location! It's way too far from the central pattaya or walking street! These part of pattaya (jomtien) is a bit laidback, thr's not much entertainment here and everytime you wnt to go to walking street 'sontheaw' ride cost between 150bt to 200bt. So you still lose the money you save on the hotel rate!  2. The surrounding is no good. This part of the town is on construction site, or these buildings are abandoned! So i can get abit frightening at night. But no problems, just that its on deserted place.  3. The rooms has rules, they will charge you not only for damage but also for dirty! Therefore if you stay here, then you got to be very very careful with their stuff.  4. Door has Gaps! Doors when closed has got gaps in between, if there's anyone whom tried to peep, i believe they can see!    I would not come here back, simply because of the location.

Ken M wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Hotel is kept extremely clean at all times.,"This place is a little off the beaten path which can be both good and bad. The bad is that you are away from all the 'action' in the Jomtien/Pattaya area which can be good on it's own, and the good part is that if you want a nice quiet place to be that is super reasonable then you have found it. It's about the equivalent of 2-3 blocks from the beach so it's just a short stroll to get there. Or take a passing songtow and head off to the Night Market or Rampoo market for some great street food for next to nothing. While the rooms can seem a little sparse from Western standards and there really isn't any view from the rooms, this isn't where I spent my waking hours. Good place to just come back to and get cleaned up so you can head back out and get some food (and maybe a beer).","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

Its got a ""white"" theme going on with a ton of lights in the ceiling that amplify the rooms whiteness when turned on. Its just not my cup of tea. You wont get that romantic golden glow here.

It's not a nice neighbourhood but it also means you are a distance from the noisy cars in the busy street.  My room was clean but very impersonal. Not a cosy room. The doors had really big openings around it and it was tried fixed with rubber bands but without mentionable success! I could look out into the hallway. Both light and noise came through easily at night.  Staff was polite and helpful. But the shower was fantastic! Loads of water and as hot as you wanted it from the large shower head.

Abby C wrote a review Jan 2016,50,"Great stay, only minor improvements needed","We were really pleasantly surprised when we arrived at this hotel. We booked a superior double room for two weeks over Christmas & new year, and could happily have stayed longer. The location is perfect; right near the beach and still set back from the noise of the main road. 10 baht buses will run you anywhere in the area from this main road. Everything in the room worked and nothing leaked, which was a real difference from the other places we've stayed in Thailand. Inside the room was spotless, but the balcony was constantly grubby. It was quiet at night, but we were woken early most mornings by the building work next door, which we disappointingly hadn't been forewarned about. Building started around 7:30am most mornings and was hard to sleep through in our room, but maybe some rooms are quieter than others. They sell tea, coffee and toast in the foyer, and there is a 30 baht washing machine right outside the hotel if their laundry prices are a little pricey for you (like they were for us). The staff were not that brilliant, but not in any way rude; I think they were maybe just shy as their English was a little limited. Everyone apart from the manager just seemed to ignore us completely, unless we approached them first. Aircon and WiFi worked well. The bed was hard but no worse than the rest of Thailand. I highly recommend this hotel!","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="

Matthew-MY wrote a review Nov 2015,20,Basic,"Basic budget hotel. Rooms are undoubtedly big and everything else is very basic.Can't expect much with such pricing. The hotel however expect a deposit of 1000 bath upon check in.    Room: The room does have a safe but the size is about 6 X 4 inches so it is not very useful. The room doors are still using the conventional type of locking system so it is rather easy to prise open which made me feel rather insecure. There were on going construction work going on outside so by 9am I was totally awake by the natural alarm clock.    Staff: The staff, they are not very well versed in almost everything because whatever I ask I only got a yes, no or I don't know answer.    Location: The hotel location is really hard to find even for the locals so had to use another hotel as a landmark for cabs. The vicinity of the hotel don't really serve much food however if anyone is willing to walk about 500m there are some food stalls outside.    Wifi: the hotel provide encrypted wifi and the stability was ok.    Conclusion: This hotel has nothing to shout about but well for a budget hotel I guess it'll suffice.","Z BY ZING $11 ($̶1̶9̶) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.884031,100.883522&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.884031,100.883522&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.879426,100.892242|12.890499,100.879494|12.874329,100.887398|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.885211,100.881126|12.879130,100.891273&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.881372,100.894005|12.883675,100.883583|12.881659,100.894012|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.881659,100.894012|12.891152,100.875732|12.877643,100.885033&signature=rhtftaaPJcS1wECUPYAwaKpNjw8="
