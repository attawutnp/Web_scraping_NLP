TheOracleofOz wrote a review Sep 2017,30,Three stars is a bit of a push,"I stayed here for three nights because, basically, my mate lives in North Pattya and his local pub is across the road (Jack Bar) and I visit him at least annually to get some beers in for my birthday. Hey! Any excuse is a good reason…  Aaanyway, It’s a quiet hotel on a busy street. Set back from the road via a short soi and circular driveway. There is off-street parking.  Entrance is an open reception area. Careful of the steps, it is quite gloomy area and the step is in an awkward spot. I tripped on it twice.  Checking in was a small nightmare as, for whatever reason, they absolutely *must* have your booking voucher in paper form to check in. Free welcome drink of juice.  I had to email them the voucher I had received so they could print it out. I would have thought the booking company would have sent them a reservation acknowledgement, too. Whatever.    Oh, to be warned and to make it easier for yourselves, too, be prepared the staff don’t speak English. I mean, there’s no reason why they should, how many hotels in, say, the UK have Thai-speaking reception staff? Exactly. And they have the same population.    Take your voucher, pass over you passport/s for photocopying, get shown your room. Relax.  My “Pool View” room had nothing of the sort – a view of some undergrowth and a disused rubbish bin is what I got.  The room itself was spacious, though, with a decent en-suite. There was an older style television, a mini-bar, two free bottles of water per day (as is normal throughout SE Asia) and a room-service menu.  Air conditioner didn’t work. Well, what I mean is while power went into the unit and one could adjust the thermostat, the refrigerant or compressor was faulty.  Not an issue for me as I basically live in Thailand now, without air conditioning, and wanted the thermostat set to 26 degrees anyway. Fan worked but the bed is about five metres from the unit so little benefit was gained.  Room was cleaned daily.  Didn’t eat there. Great Italian place on the street outside, to the left. Sensational. Bar across the road. Ten minutes’ walk to the nightlife of Pattaya if that’s your thing. I’d get a motorcycle/taxi to the really pumping area of Soi 6 as it’s quite a hike from here.  This place is ideal for the quieter tourist or, like myself, an ex-pat not interested in the “specialist tourism attractions” for which Pattaya is renowned.    Three stars is a push. Two-and-a-half. But not bad considering the room rate of about $AUD32 a night.    Will return. With voucher.

Markus Z wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Great value !,"For me now it's the 3rd time since March 2015 to be a loyal guest of the Garden Lodge. The initial core of this hotel is a bit aged but well equipped and maintained. Also just some years ago a new block with rooms was added.  All rooms are offering king size bed, AC, Int'l. Cable -TV, fridge, balcony and on request a catering service. The small but never overcrowded swimming-pool in the central garden invites for a rest and chill-out.  Most of the guests are middle-aged or elderly Germans, Austrians, Europeans.  So there's no trouble ahead with ""exotic"" behaviour a mayority of twens or some tourists from e.g. Russia, India or China might cause.  The location of this Hotel in Naklua road is quite perfect to have closeby many options for restaurants, beer bars, shops, money exchange, pharmacies, dentists a.s.o. To go downtown Baht taxis commute just in front of the door, and it takes only about 10 minutes to reach the mid of the Beach road or the Walking street.  For me the Garden Lodge is a ""budget oasis' and definetly more worth than just 2 stars!","GARDEN LODGE - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.952958,100.887993&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.952958,100.887993&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.948890,100.889076|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.955278,100.890602|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.949746,100.890533|12.951634,100.887924&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950723,100.891548|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.950231,100.889435|12.953860,100.887932|12.949386,100.886574|12.950972,100.890175|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589&signature=iW8sJ8jI_itlV113s_S-URJ70Ug="

This is probably somewhere where no technology is used but rather A nice book to read on your balcony or near the pool which is just pure relaxation!","GARDEN LODGE - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.952958,100.887993&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.952958,100.887993&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.948890,100.889076|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.955278,100.890602|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.949746,100.890533|12.951634,100.887924&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950723,100.891548|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.950231,100.889435|12.953860,100.887932|12.949386,100.886574|12.950972,100.890175|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589&signature=iW8sJ8jI_itlV113s_S-URJ70Ug="
Amelies_Mommy wrote a review Aug 2015,30,Ok stay,"Unfortunately they let the place run down.. The rooms are clean for Thai standards, but bathroom the smallest I've ever seen anywhere.. Don't expect too much, you get what you pay for here.. Staff is friendly. Pool is clean and probably the best part of the hotel. There are no pool towels, so better bring your own. Don't let your clothes washed here. The cleaning lady told me, she is washing them by hand, and drying them in the sun, so it may take up to a week because she needs to seperate colors... For that price, I expected machine wash and not an old lady having to clean my dirty clothes after work to make a couple bugs extra. The cleaning staff however is very trying and do a good job!! Should tip them well... The clientel here is, well... the typical Pattaya tourist. The first night, there was a fight in our apartment complex at 3 am, slamming doors, screaming, and breaking things. My 7 year old daughter was pretty scared. Overall, it's not worth more than 2 stars, and I wouldn't stay here again.","GARDEN LODGE - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.952958,100.887993&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.952958,100.887993&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.948890,100.889076|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.955278,100.890602|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.949746,100.890533|12.951634,100.887924&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950723,100.891548|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.950231,100.889435|12.953860,100.887932|12.949386,100.886574|12.950972,100.890175|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589&signature=iW8sJ8jI_itlV113s_S-URJ70Ug="

wilystoat wrote a review May 2014,30,Functional,"I stayed here for many nights on several occasions. For the price, decent rooms. Nice reception staff. The cleaners have a bit of an attitude. Swimming pool good. Nice food at pool bar.  Possibly the biggest negative is the bar staff. A really lazy, couldn't care less attitude.  Also I don't really understand what hotel security is there for. Me and my rentagirlfriend were in my room at only about 9pm, just watching a movie and having some food when a German guy in the next room banged on my door and wall. I opened the door and before I could say anything he picked me up and threw me against the wall, cracking 3 ribs. He then locked himself in his room. I think he was envious because he had been leering at my rentagirlfriend in her bikini from his balcony, and his wife was a bit of a minger.  Hotel security did NOTHING.  The next day he checked out, because he knew my friends were coming to deal with him. Lol  Another time, there was an extremely drunk German at the pool bar who was abusing everybody, even telling an elderly lady ""F you"" for no reason. The staff did NOTHING.

I have been two times already here and i will come back here when i will be in Pattaya again.","GARDEN LODGE - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.952958,100.887993&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.952958,100.887993&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.948890,100.889076|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.955278,100.890602|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.949746,100.890533|12.951634,100.887924&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950723,100.891548|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.950231,100.889435|12.953860,100.887932|12.949386,100.886574|12.950972,100.890175|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589&signature=iW8sJ8jI_itlV113s_S-URJ70Ug="

TheOracleofOz wrote a review Sep 2017,30,Three stars is a bit of a push,"I stayed here for three nights because, basically, my mate lives in North Pattya and his local pub is across the road (Jack Bar) and I visit him at least annually to get some beers in for my birthday. Hey! Any excuse is a good reason…  Aaanyway, It’s a quiet hotel on a busy street. Set back from the road via a short soi and circular driveway. There is off-street parking.  Entrance is an open reception area. Careful of the steps, it is quite gloomy area and the step is in an awkward spot. I tripped on it twice.  Checking in was a small nightmare as, for whatever reason, they absolutely *must* have your booking voucher in paper form to check in. Free welcome drink of juice.  I had to email them the voucher I had received so they could print it out. I would have thought the booking company would have sent them a reservation acknowledgement, too. Whatever.    Oh, to be warned and to make it easier for yourselves, too, be prepared the staff don’t speak English. I mean, there’s no reason why they should, how many hotels in, say, the UK have Thai-speaking reception staff? Exactly. And they have the same population.    Take your voucher, pass over you passport/s for photocopying, get shown your room. Relax.  My “Pool View” room had nothing of the sort – a view of some undergrowth and a disused rubbish bin is what I got.  The room itself was spacious, though, with a decent en-suite. There was an older style television, a mini-bar, two free bottles of water per day (as is normal throughout SE Asia) and a room-service menu.  Air conditioner didn’t work. Well, what I mean is while power went into the unit and one could adjust the thermostat, the refrigerant or compressor was faulty.  Not an issue for me as I basically live in Thailand now, without air conditioning, and wanted the thermostat set to 26 degrees anyway. Fan worked but the bed is about five metres from the unit so little benefit was gained.  Room was cleaned daily.  Didn’t eat there. Great Italian place on the street outside, to the left. Sensational. Bar across the road. Ten minutes’ walk to the nightlife of Pattaya if that’s your thing. I’d get a motorcycle/taxi to the really pumping area of Soi 6 as it’s quite a hike from here.  This place is ideal for the quieter tourist or, like myself, an ex-pat not interested in the “specialist tourism attractions” for which Pattaya is renowned.    Three stars is a push. Two-and-a-half. But not bad considering the room rate of about $AUD32 a night.    Will return. With voucher.

Markus Z wrote a review Oct 2016,50,Great value !,"For me now it's the 3rd time since March 2015 to be a loyal guest of the Garden Lodge. The initial core of this hotel is a bit aged but well equipped and maintained. Also just some years ago a new block with rooms was added.  All rooms are offering king size bed, AC, Int'l. Cable -TV, fridge, balcony and on request a catering service. The small but never overcrowded swimming-pool in the central garden invites for a rest and chill-out.  Most of the guests are middle-aged or elderly Germans, Austrians, Europeans.  So there's no trouble ahead with ""exotic"" behaviour a mayority of twens or some tourists from e.g. Russia, India or China might cause.  The location of this Hotel in Naklua road is quite perfect to have closeby many options for restaurants, beer bars, shops, money exchange, pharmacies, dentists a.s.o. To go downtown Baht taxis commute just in front of the door, and it takes only about 10 minutes to reach the mid of the Beach road or the Walking street.  For me the Garden Lodge is a ""budget oasis' and definetly more worth than just 2 stars!","GARDEN LODGE - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.952958,100.887993&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.952958,100.887993&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.948890,100.889076|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.955278,100.890602|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.949746,100.890533|12.951634,100.887924&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950723,100.891548|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.950231,100.889435|12.953860,100.887932|12.949386,100.886574|12.950972,100.890175|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589&signature=iW8sJ8jI_itlV113s_S-URJ70Ug="
rosieakauola wrote a review Apr 2016,50,Very Tropical place,"We loved the tropical feel of this place! The beautiful aroma of the plumeria tree outside our room was bliss!! The room was a reasonable size which had a nice little balcony overlooking the tropical garden and pool. The staff were so nice to us 🙂 even some of the guests staying there were friendly too!!    There is also 2 tiki hut bars to chill back and have a few cocktails at 🌺🍹    The only downside is the wifi connection, it was hard to get connection. This is probably somewhere where no technology is used but rather A nice book to read on your balcony or near the pool which is just pure relaxation!","GARDEN LODGE - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.952958,100.887993&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.952958,100.887993&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.948890,100.889076|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.955278,100.890602|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.949746,100.890533|12.951634,100.887924&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950723,100.891548|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.950231,100.889435|12.953860,100.887932|12.949386,100.886574|12.950972,100.890175|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589&signature=iW8sJ8jI_itlV113s_S-URJ70Ug="
Amelies_Mommy wrote a review Aug 2015,30,Ok stay,"Unfortunately they let the place run down.. The rooms are clean for Thai standards, but bathroom the smallest I've ever seen anywhere.. Don't expect too much, you get what you pay for here.. Staff is friendly. Pool is clean and probably the best part of the hotel. There are no pool towels, so better bring your own. Don't let your clothes washed here. The cleaning lady told me, she is washing them by hand, and drying them in the sun, so it may take up to a week because she needs to seperate colors... For that price, I expected machine wash and not an old lady having to clean my dirty clothes after work to make a couple bugs extra. The cleaning staff however is very trying and do a good job!! Should tip them well... The clientel here is, well... the typical Pattaya tourist. The first night, there was a fight in our apartment complex at 3 am, slamming doors, screaming, and breaking things. My 7 year old daughter was pretty scared. Overall, it's not worth more than 2 stars, and I wouldn't stay here again.","GARDEN LODGE - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.952958,100.887993&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.952958,100.887993&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.948890,100.889076|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.955278,100.890602|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.949746,100.890533|12.951634,100.887924&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950723,100.891548|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.950231,100.889435|12.953860,100.887932|12.949386,100.886574|12.950972,100.890175|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589&signature=iW8sJ8jI_itlV113s_S-URJ70Ug="

wilystoat wrote a review May 2014,30,Functional,"I stayed here for many nights on several occasions. For the price, decent rooms. Nice reception staff. The cleaners have a bit of an attitude. Swimming pool good. Nice food at pool bar.  Possibly the biggest negative is the bar staff. A really lazy, couldn't care less attitude.  Also I don't really understand what hotel security is there for. Me and my rentagirlfriend were in my room at only about 9pm, just watching a movie and having some food when a German guy in the next room banged on my door and wall. I opened the door and before I could say anything he picked me up and threw me against the wall, cracking 3 ribs. He then locked himself in his room. I think he was envious because he had been leering at my rentagirlfriend in her bikini from his balcony, and his wife was a bit of a minger.  Hotel security did NOTHING.  The next day he checked out, because he knew my friends were coming to deal with him. Lol  Another time, there was an extremely drunk German at the pool bar who was abusing everybody, even telling an elderly lady ""F you"" for no reason. The staff did NOTHING.

Márton T wrote a review Jan 2011,40,good for the price,"very good location and the staff is o.k.  The swimming pool is clean and there is pool for childrens. The garden is nice. The rooms are clean and good for this price in Pattaya but it needs some reconditioning and the showers too. The restaurant is weak, better to eat elsewhere, there are many restaurant and buffet and marts near to the hotel.  I have been two times already here and i will come back here when i will be in Pattaya again.","GARDEN LODGE - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.952958,100.887993&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.952958,100.887993&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.950249,100.888557|12.948890,100.889076|12.951095,100.886932|12.956059,100.889862&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.955278,100.890602|12.952180,100.889206|12.951991,100.888176|12.951272,100.887787|12.951900,100.888138|12.949746,100.890533|12.951634,100.887924&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.950723,100.891548|12.950534,100.885422|12.952090,100.887939|12.950231,100.889435|12.953860,100.887932|12.949386,100.886574|12.950972,100.890175|12.951667,100.885216|12.952188,100.886589&signature=iW8sJ8jI_itlV113s_S-URJ70Ug="
