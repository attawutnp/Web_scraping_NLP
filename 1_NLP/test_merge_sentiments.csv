0,A & M VILLA PATTAYA - Hotel Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"A really nice house, hot tub on top with a view over the local neighborhood, huge room with fridge. Had a good chat with the Berlin-German and felt him to be very welcoming.    Not at the beach, but not bad for a start to downtown. Big C supermarket in walking distance, eateries around the corner, as well as 7/11.    Thumbs up, recommended! What can I say?  We are here now as I write this and all I can say is Andy and his wife are really friendly folk who look after their customers.  Villa is in a great location...away from the road and traffic but close enough to restaurants..massage parlours..bars...shopping centres busses ...rooms offer everything you need...air con...fans...comfortable beds...hot showers...tv with English speaking channels...towels..motorbike hire...taxi service..jacuzzi..rooftop terraces with comfortable seating...etc...nice bar chucked in with reasonably priced drinks too....i like Andy and A M Villa...if you are in pataya give it a try because for the price it's a bargain. After such great reviews for this place we were so dissapointed. After a 7 hour bus journey we arrived to be rudely spoken to by the owner because we did not reply to him that day when he messaged me asking what time I would arrive. Well thats because i was on a bus with no wifi. Then to be told we had to stay at his family hotel as when booking threw booking.com this dose not confirm your booking however booking.com says it dose. I have never had this issue anywhere else in the world. The hotel he took us to was ok but not what we had wanted from our time in pattaya. Also which was kind the owner said he would collect us at 12noon on our departure date and take us to the bus. However by 12.20 on that day he still never showed up until i messaged him. He did get us to the bus just with 5 mins to spare. I wouldnt reccomend if you get put else where and i cant comment on this place as we never stayed. Very clean. Excellent location. Friendly owners. We booked two rooms top floor, one with the bath tub and another without, for our 4D3N stay in Pattaya. The room was surprisingly big; bed was good but could be better; A/C was cold enough; working flatscreen tv; clean utensils, working fridge, free instant coffee, working microwave, and free bottled water everyday; jacuzzi, bathtub and shower was good, we didn't mind about not having much hot water since it's very hot out anyway. They also have vaults in the room which is a plus. For it's price, you'd be surprise because you will get more than what you pay. Coming back from a tiring trip around Pattaya or just staying in, you'll definitely love every second of your stay here. I highly recommend this place if you ever visit in Pattaya. Love this place will be back for the water fight in April, nice staff I checked out and travelled about for a bit came back to Pattaya to get bus ticket to Bangkok for my flight, it was a Sunday no where was open, so I said I try would Andy and his super friendly wife be able to help me, I woke them out of bed, not only did they help me they brought me all the way to Bangkok for my flight for a small fee of course cheaper than any other taxi by far, very clean rooms, Jacuzzi and a nice little bar down stairs, and away from all the noise of Pattaya, 15 min walk to beach street, recommend this place all day long. If you don't like this place, I'm afraid you will be happy no where. Fantastic place to stay Andy and May are lovely people very welcoming will defo stay again.  Very good price and rooms are comfortable I slept extremely well I cannot fault the a and m villa  Andy also picked us up and dropped us off at the airport much cheaper than a taxi üëç book with confidence I stayed 2 nights at A&M Villa on August 2016. very easy access to Pattaya walking streets, shopping malls. The owner is a German fun type gentlemen and always with a smile and ready to help. rooms are very clean. daily Cleaning, Free mini bar with beers. Andy and his wife both are very friendly and always helped us like arranging taxis, Day tours.  If you are a fresh traveler to Pattaya, i strongly recommend this place to stay. very easy to access most of the people and you can get a very friendly service from Andy. The room is huge but dated. The kitchenette cabinates are well worn. The stone bathroom feels damp with water leaking around the toilet. Our room was right off reception so we were woken up by people listening to TV & from outsode the window. Its a qiet setting just a shame about the amount of unnecessarty internal noise. The thick layer of dust on the bedsode lamp, hair in the shower & sink and more haor wjen I pulled back tge duvet was gross. This place is fine for a quick stopover but you can definately find better for the money. My cousin came to visit me and we got a spontaneous idea to go to Pattaya, after few hours we arrived. We searched from internet and found this place, but we didn't book it through internet. Finally when we arrived there, they told us that they have only one free room left, and it is expensive. Quickly I opened my phone and made a booking online with much cheaper price! And we ended up getting an amazing room for 600baht per two people. We had even a small kitchen! Room was nice on the highest floor with aircon and fan! Also next to our room was a tiny 'pool' with sunbathing chairs. Nothing fancy but really cute! Also our room was cleaned even on our last day before the check out, we just went to 7/11 for 15 minutes, when we came back we had new towels and the bed was made up!  Actually at the beginning we booked it only for one night, but we ended up staying for two, first the wanted us to change room for the second night as well as to pay more, but luckily everything stayed same for the second night!  It is a bit far from city centre, and food on a road next to it is not really good, but it was good place to go after walking street and rest!    PS! Since I am Estonian, there is Estonian liqueur store close to this villa, go and try some 'Vana Tallinn' in Asia! :)    Would definitely go again! We had a pleasant stay there and spent some good night of sleep. The room was huge, like a little flat, with a kitchen. Some tea and coffee, but not kettle though ? So actually useless.  The bathroom was nice, but a bit dirty, and the boiler was broken, so we had to take cold showers. Not a big deal, but it was supposed to be included in the price of the room.  We are still looking for the private swimming pool as well..  The staff was not very friendly, barely speaking English, or totally invisible, except the last day where we met the manager (we guess) who was quite nice.  I give it a good score despite of all this because we had a good time there, watching movies and relaxing, the bed was huge and confortable, and it was for us, well located, near lots of supermarkets, and a bit away from the centre, full of noise and prostitution. Very close to the bus station (though we were ripped off by the baht taxi driver), and located near many restaurant and departmental stores. We walked to the beach (~20 mins) and Alcazar (~15 mins).  Owner is very helpful; we even got our luggage hauled up to the studio!  We had the deluxe king studio on the 2nd floor, which, for 490 baht, was an absolute bargain, keeping in mind the steep prices in Pattaya.  Our studio had a double bed, 2 bedside tables, a wardrobe with a safe inside, 2 sofas and a coffee table, and also a set of shelves.  It also had a refrigerator, an electric kettle (didn't work, but we didn't use this), plates, cups, glasses and a steel sink.  The bathroom has everything from toothbrush-toothpaste sets to other toiletries. True, the toilet paper wasnt folded to a triangle, but who cares anyway! A hand towel and bath towel each were also provided, as were slippers.  There were lounge chairs and sunbeds on the terrace outside, as well as a whirlpool! There is also another terrace on the 1st floor.  Ample plug points, great wifi and a sound night's sleep!  Free bottles of water were provided, and the owner let us check out late at 21:15 instead of 12:00! This place wins hands down; will be back here if I'm ever in Pattaya again! the hotel is located in a residential neighbourhood. very quiet area but still close to the action, you can take a motorbike taxi to walking street or soi buakao in only a couple of minutes.    for the location and price this place offers some of the best value you can get    very nice staff and probably the fastest internet in any hotel in thailand (40mbit). I seriously recommend you stay at this Guesthouse. The location is very good. It's close to downtown Pattaya and at night it's actually quiet so it's easy to get a good nights sleep, unlike most places I have stayed at in Pattaya.  The staff are very friendly and helpful. The WIFI is very good which again, I can't say about many places I've stayed at in Pattaya. The facilities are very good to for what you pay for.  You definitely get your moneys worth. Staying at this Guesthouse is a bargain! Me and My cousin stayed here.Clean Room For 490 baht. The Room has difference sizes. The one we got is okey room is a small room with private bathroom,hotshower, provided with small shampoo and showergel, toothbrush and toothpaste. The Aircon is good, the bed is big is king size,bed is soft and pillow too. The blanket is nice. This room has a kitchen, with thermo pot for your hot coffee free black coffee as complimentary and also have big fridge. The Wifi is okey not high speed but is okey. They have microwave in outside,toaster you can use for free. They have flat screen tv but no Cable only thai channel.    ""The Bad things in this Hotel.""    The bathroom is unbelievable smelly. The smell comes from the hole of the bathroom and the smell is very strong. You cant breath here everytime you use the bathroom. Its very Nasty!. I wish the owner can fixed this problem.    No Laundry service here.You have to go outside. To do your laundry . Its not that far they have everywhere.    The 3rd problem is, you have to walk way way far. As they dont have Bath Tuktuk. You have to walk 10 mins to go to Robinson to catch the transportation to go the Beach and Walking street.    But otherwise this Guesthouse is good for tight budget Backpacker.The place is quite, very close to 7 eleven, Familymart, Restaurant, Bar. And the Robinson BigC Extra. This hotel is very nice. Is quite comfortable, the room was very big and next to the jacuzzi on the rooftop. Is very far (if you want to walk everywhere) but is quite and no noise around if you just want to relax. The staff is very friendly and they even gave me a welcome drink! Overall all is highly recommended! Great place far away from noise but also close to Big C extra and main central road  A little dates but nice  Not much parking for cars but there is only 9 units in building  Someone is at reception 24 hours a day and feels fairly safe around area  Large size rooms with large bed  A few Mosquitos  No lift in building so 2 flights of stairs each time if you stay on 3rd floor  Jacuzzi on top but cold water  Negotiate with reception about price  Don't go through internet or you will pay double the price than ringing direct  A little hard to find first time but after that it's easy  Recommended place to stay A really nice house, hot tub on top with a view over the local neighborhood, huge room with fridge. Had a good chat with the Berlin-German and felt him to be very welcoming.    Not at the beach, but not bad for a start to downtown. Big C supermarket in walking distance, eateries around the corner, as well as 7/11.    Thumbs up, recommended! What can I say?

1,A A PATTAYA HOTEL $22 ($Ã∂2Ã∂9Ã∂) - Prices & Reviews - Thailand - Tripadvisor,"Older place, bit tired, but good value for money. Location is very central and handy to many restaurants, shopping etc. Has swimming pool and great views too. Have stayed here about four times now. Friendly staff. So.. this hotel is a perfect location overlooking the beach and is only a 10 minute walk to Walking Street. The pool offers views over the beach and is a nice place to catch some sun in the afternoon. Compared to other places around this hotel is ALLOT cheaper which was attractive when booking.    I would suggest if you are booking primarily to be out all night drinking then this is a good hotel for you.    The music from next door ‚ÄúHooters‚Äù and other bars goes off until 2am every night which is when they close, and is very loud as the windows are not double glazed. The room was small and despite being clean as a first appearance at night ALL of the bugs come out. Me and my partner were very close to booking another hotel to stay in, however decided against it in the end due to the costs involved.    Would not stay here again. I have been to Pattaya 6 times with my girlfriend and we always stay here. The staff are great, and the location is perfect. The only hotel in the area with a pool on the 4th floor overlooking the beach, and Beach Road. If you want that anywhere else along the beach you will be paying five times the price. And some people mention the overweight men around the pool - you got to remember, this is Pattaya, they are everywhere. You do get some music from Hooters next door, but normally stops around midnight, and if you're in Pattaya, and in your room at midnight, then maybe you shouldn't be here, lol. Also, the wi-fi is one of the fastest I've had at any hotel. I live in Bangkok, so it's only two hours away, and we go here because even though Pattaya has a bad reputation regarding the sex trade, it also has an amazing beach and collection of islands, and two large malls, as well as a floating market and many other great days out. Great location and a decent value for the dollar if you are comparing hotels near the beach. In the states or Europe rooms would be hundreds of dollars per night at its location. However major improvements still need to be made. TV's selection of channels are very poor, TV reception is poor, and Wi-Fi is really a hassle because you have to logon on every time you leave the hotel and they change passwords up to every 3 days. Beds are typical South East Asian, thin and hard. Staff from Alvin at the front desk to all the maids are fantastic. The hotel is very safe with doormen and security. Best avoid if female. Stayed here with my sister,left after 2 nights.felt very unsafe as no other females staying. Went to pool for a swim. The pool deck was covered in men recovering from the previous night. Felt like a piece of meat on view.room was OK. Staff are a bit slap dash. according the price level this hotel is goood  really good location closed to everywhere middle of pattaya  do not have so much expectation about the luxury  wifi -----ok  breakfast do not try  cleaning ok I stayed here at the end of July for 10 nights, the location on soi 13 next to Beach Road is ideal unless you are going to Pattaya for an early nights sleep. Hooters is next door and playing loud music from 2pm till early hours in the morning. Walking in to the hotel, the reception is fantastic, from there it goes down hill. The rooms are warn and need work, the pool seems it needs a good clean and the staff never seem to smile. we stayn in this hotel for three nights the hotel rooms is moderate no clear! the lokation its very nice! the staf very good!!! the loby in hotel looks good ! but the rooms ist to old and not clear..! I am staying at AA Hotel near beach road on soi 13 until tomorrow. I will then check out and never come back.  The staff in the recepetion are so rude you won¬¥t believe it. They have a body language, and verbal language, that clearly reveals their utter contempt for customers or foreigners (one or both)  The manager/owner of this hotel clearly has no contact with his/her organization thus allowing this anti-customer culture to breed. Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. Great location only a few minutes walk to shopping centres, markets and walking street. Guest friendly hotel. Though the bathrooms leave alot to be desired, the paint was peeling off the ceiling and doors due to the fans not working. The bath curtain was dirty aswell. The service was ok. Just finished 2 nights at this hotel. The only good thing about the hotel is the rooms has uninterrupted a/c and hotwater. Rooms are small and the bathrooms is horrible. Starting from the reception, ""0"" customer service and PR, which you do not expect in Pattaya area anyway. Agent has paid for room with breakfast, however, since most people get room only, the reception never read the voucher and gave us a realy hard time during breakfast. On top of that, the breakfast was only 2 slices of bread, 2 not properly done bullseys eggs, coffee, orange juice and few crum fried unedible bacon slices on both days.    One more + point is that the hotel is just few steps away fm the beach and the beach road. The most unbearable incident is by 4 to 5 pm everyday a lady comes with water and knock on your door irrespective of whether you are a sleep or not and say "" Hello Waterrrrrr"". Doesn't really matter if you say it is inconvenient for you.    If you are looking for a place, there are plenty outside with all you can eat buffett. Rooms starting from 700 Baht and 150 for Buffett. I would definitely avoid visiting this hotel in future. this is a very low cost hotel 1000 baht night. Building is old turn of century architcecture with grand lobby and very spartan rooms. Clean but not modern in any way. Free Wifi plus nice 4th story pool overlooking the beach are the best feature other than it being right dead center of beach road.    Staff if friendly and very accommadating but this hotel caters mostly to budget travelers who are indifferent to not having updated amenities. There is a fridge in the room and the beds are comfortable and clean. The best thing about this place is the looks of the lobby.  Stayed in room 504, Every time one used the shower water poured out from the back of the bath  all over the floor. Reported but nothing done about it. Mould all through the bathroom and it looked like silastic man had run amok on the tiles (or maybe it was his kid).The bottom of the bathroom door is completely rotted away. Lift stopped working for 2 days.Used the stairs to find washing bags piled high on the stair well on 3rd floor. Carpets in the stair well filthy. Holes in the sheets,looked liked blood streak on the wall beside the bed, I could go on and on. Room was cleaned but no toilet paper supplied ,spoke to cleaning lady but she did not believe me had to come to room and check then said"" solly I am very busy have to many rooms to clean and forget paper "" Tried to book out after the first night but could not find any accommodation close by being Xmas time.  Never again. Really great staff...brilliant location..unfortunately I booked through AGODA. I had to change my booking by 3 days later...contacted their customer ""change bookings"" by e mail...got nothing back...then they said my booking was in a totally different name...checked my booking number and it was correct....several unanswered e mails later I had to re-book and pay again with another company...hotel staff very understanding and even offered me a free first evening dinner as they have had a lot of problems with AGODA...my advice...book with the Hotel or another company...avoid AGODA like the plague ! So dirty I walked in the room and walked out immediately. A place can be cheap and dont have to look posh but at least be clean. The lobby carpet have stains every where and looked totally disgusting. The sheets on the bed had stains on it. I end up staying at the Sandy springs down the road. Much better and clean. Guy's close your eyes and book this hotel, i have stayed here 5 Nights, genuinely very nice place, very nice and friendly staff, they will assist you in taking the baggage everything is very nearby from there. Interiors are good. Dont miss the Hopf house in the same lane, for taste of Italiano Pizza's. Seven eleven stores, Ripleys everything is at a 2 minute distance. This hotel has a Superb Beach-view from the Pool side. Staff very helpful room big clean and tidy very well situated for the beach and walking street restaurants close by to eat or very good restaurant in the hotel it selfwill stay there again booking a room for November in fact Stayed here for two weeks and had a great time .  The location is perfect and the hotel is very quiet a rare thing in Pattaya.  Pool on the roof is a great bonus and you can have drinks and meals by the pool.  Clean rooms and reception/ hall carpets need replacing but for the price can't complain.  Free WiFi in hotel including rooms.  Staff are quite helpful but not over friendly.  Would definitely come back when next in Pattaya and would recommend to all. the rooms are basic and can get good views from some .went there for one night as had fishing trip next day. would stay there again. i would book first to get the better rooms . you are right in the middle of everything I usually stay here because of the central location whenever I stay for 1 or max 2 nights. Even though right in the middle of everything, the hotel is fairly quiet. Rooms are old and furnished very basic. Some of the rooms have a great view onto the bay. Basically, you get what you pay for. The average rate at the reception is 1000 THB in the high season, which seems to be somewhat standard in Pattaya, while I heard that there is better places available for the price while not that centrally located. No in room safes but safe deposit boxes are available at the reception. The beach in the high season is everything but nice and clean. Packed up with beach chairs and sun covers all the way to the water line. Bottom line: Good budget hotel for short stays at a central location but not suited for families or a long term beach vacation. I chose this hotel based on its location, price - which allowed us to book a seaview suite - and the view of the beach from the pool area. The first day or two after arriving we wrent sure we had made a wise decision and considered moving but in the end the pros outweighed the cons as far as we were concerned. However this is NOT a hotel for families or for a couple looking for a romantic holiday. It is budget accomodation with a brilliant location and views.  I am going to post pictures so you will be able to see that the hotel is rather 'tired' in some areas. Indeed areas like the carpets in the passages and the pool lounger cushions are in a very bad condition. Our bathroom also was somewhat mismatched and the towels in the room were threadbare (and limited to one per person.)  But that aside - the room was spacious and clean (if in need of some paint). The pool did deliver the view (altho no shade from about 1-30pm). Breakfasts were well presented and for 75 Baht you got two fried eggs, 2 pieces of toast, bacon, jam, coffee and orange juice.  The guests were primarily men, some on their own, some with their Thai ladies. We were two western ladies travelling together but didnt feel unwelcome in any way.  Basically we found you get what you pay for - and in terms of location, room (not bathroom) and views - we were satisfied with our choice. Most of the staff were very obliging but this is more likely family run than anything and the facilities and services are not based on what you find in hotel chains. For example - not only wasnt there a hairdryer in the room - there wasnt one to borrow from reception. (No safes in the room either but that is probably not going to be a deciding factor - there are safety deposit boxes downstairs.)  There is one lift - looking a little sad, but it did its job and with rooms to the 7th floor at least - its very necessary. Most staff are very helpfull and polite. The rooms are a decent size and very close to the action. Hotel does not charge for additional guests, so thats great. For ¬£20 or so, you cant go too wrong. However, there are no in room safes which did complicate things.  I am travelling back to thailand and plan to use this hotel again. I travelled with 7 of my friends and stayed for 10 nights. Previously I have been in pattaya 24 timesover 14 years and stayed at many hotels. My friends and I all agree we had a fantastic stay and would definitely go back next time. No cockroaches were seen during our stay. In house room and food service was enjoyable. The rooms have been repainted and refurbished. Value for money, no doubt. Fantastic sea view rooms. The staff were very friendly and helpful in all many ways. Congratulations A.A Pattaya hotel. See you soon.  'Ross from Australia'    i Unbeatable beachfront location in the heart of everything and the most wonderful, trustworthy, helpful, and friendly staff (from front office, bellmen, and housekeeping) you could ever desire. However, there is a fatal flaw to this property. It is overrun with cockroaches. Although there is monthly professional pest control, the adult and baby roaches are everywhere, and they are present in large numbers on ALL floors and ALL rooms. I got tired of smushing the dozen or so cockroaches about the room every time upon entering, so I would capture them in a wad of toilet paper and give them a spiraling raft ride down the commode, and eventually progressed to blowing them one by one with a puff of air from my lungs from the bathroom vanity into the commode like a field goal kicker. The pillows smelled like an ashtray. This hotel is WAY overdue for a renovation. It needs all mattresses replaced and a serious, serious fumigation during a short term property shutdown. Current pest control measures do nothing as the spraying isn't reaching their lairs in the ceilings and walls. I was worried about transporting roach eggs back with me on personal effects. Beautiful 4th floor seaview swimming pool that is tiny and the water is cloudy. Black mold is pervasive on the grout of the shower tub walls. English TV channel availability is pitiful compared to nearby hotels. This is the cheapest hotel on soi 13 and for a little more you could do better. I visit Pattaya every year and have stayed in a number of hotels but in all honesty for location and price this hotel is hard to beat the staff are very helpfull and within a few days greet you by first name whenever they meet you,the rooms are kept cleen and changed daily the A/C works but each room look out over the sea so there is a nice breeze if you dont like it,it has a small pool in the third floor and loungers for sun bathing you can get food or the terrace or in your room but above all you are in the heart of the beach/town my only critisism is the lift small and slow and only one,but for me its the only place I will stay, Terry Rude low class staff, not a ""Thai experience."" Old Hotel, needs to be updated if they are going to charge those prices. I stayed at the AA Pattaya Hotel (the one closest to Beach Road) for several months. Although it was not the nicest hotel in Pattaya it was a very good hotel. I never had one thing come up missing and all the services were very acceptable. The front desk personnel were super nice and I had a great time staying in Pattaya. The maids and wait staff were excellent and always helpful. While I was there they were updating the Carpeting in several of the rooms and the hotel sprayed for insects regularly.(As is the case in tropical climates) When I return to Pattaya I will try to stay at AA again. The Jewelry Store there is very nice also. Ican't remember everyone's name that worked in the Hotel but they were all very nice people. Dear reader,    I recently stayed at the named hotel with two other friends and may I say this is a hotel to be avoided at all costs. I stayed at this hotel for a period of eight days and when I arrived the staff were pleasent explained everything to us. However, as days went on we began to have poor experiences of this place which changed are view. While Pattaya is known for its wild nights there were certain standards that were unacceptable.    Firstly I noticed very young girls less than 16 years of age being let in with elderly men in their rooms for the obvious reasons. Although this is illegal this hotel seemed to have overlooked this matter for its regular customers. This was very sickening with gave me a bitter taste of this hotel. I informed the hotel staff who said that it happens and that they had to look after their customers and often ignore what goes on.    As days went on I found that hotel room was infested with tiny red ants and insects and on part of the room I found a nest. I was refused a refund or another room and had to pay the cleaner extra on the side to remove the nest.    Few days later I had my safe key stolen by the staff which was kept in a hidden place inside the room. It did not occur to me why someone would do this as there was a clear record of who accessed the safe. When i informed the staff at the hotel i was told that I had to pay 3000 Bahts for a replacement key. I had no choice but to pay this as I was threatened with police if i did not pay. My friend the following day also found his key taken and he to had paid 3000 baht. The pattern became very obvious. The cleaners and staff tend to take the key and the staff then charge the guests for the money which they pocket and once the guest leaves they make the key available again for the next guest. My friend speaks the language but the staff were unaware of this and he heard the conversation in my presence as they laughed at us thinking that we did not know. One staff said this is a regular earner!    My last experience was when i gave in clothes for laundry and found that they had shrunk when they were returned to me. These were very expensive socks and garments and when I asked to be compensated for the damage I was told that they would not do it but will not charge me for the laundry. When i said this was unacceptable I was told that they would call the police and ensure that I do not board my plane the following day which I clearly could not afford to do.    People I would avoid this hotel at every costs and more so if you have a family. Do not keep your safe key in the room or give anything for laundry. It is not worth it as there as much cheaper and nice hotels around closer to walking street. Thank you for taking time to read this and i hope it benefits you.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.895030,100.875320&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.895030,100.875320&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.891585,100.874062|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.896970,100.871788|12.893726,100.876503|12.897324,100.873306|12.892040,100.873306|12.895888,100.871193|12.894398,100.874542|12.894528,100.871063|12.896873,100.871773|12.894320,100.874474&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.892222,100.876945|12.891152,100.875732|12.891460,100.876312|12.893725,100.873589|12.894181,100.871368|12.894294,100.874367|12.897381,100.874458|12.890904,100.874466|12.894560,100.871880&signature=2ZTHxQTR33sgTLhVev-eB_vXP00=",0.9999,Positive
2,"AB' PALUSO RETREAT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","Stayed here during the KMK50 trail run event, resort was fully booked. We arrived late so got one of the lousiest rooms in the resort. Floor & sheets were dusty, fridge not working, closet doors broken, towel rail in the bathroom was rusty and about to snap off. When we checked out in the afternoon the next day, no one was around and the security guard told us to just leave the key at the counter because the staff had gone home! Due to the Coronavirus pandemic the hotel was closed but temporarily opened for us. Our friend whose house is in walking distance had booked 3 rooms for us so that we could stay nearby as he had invited us for his birthday celebration. The hotel can be reached from highway 7 leading to Rayong but who would stay here, far away from the sea. We had pool view rooms and of course it was quiet because we were the only guests. The hotel comprise of a bar, a big restaurant, well equipped gym, spa, pool and garden but except for the pool the facilities were closed thus I cannot comment on the food/breakfast normally served. The rooms are spacious, the room facilities are sufficient, good lighting, wardrobe, fridge, desk; my friends complained that the bed were too high and the aircondition did not cool sufficiently. In 2 rooms the cover of the toilet seat was not fixed at all. I cannot imagine to stay at a hotel in the middle of nowhere but probably they fill the hotel with golfers and through functions. The staff we met only at the check in, friendly. This hotel is a huge disappointment, the rooms are dirty, the breakfast is cold and repetitive. The restaurant is horribly overpriced with the cocktails starting at 220baht and the food being overpriced for basic stuff. 150baht for a takeaway coffee. It‚Äôs ridiculous. While the staff on reception are lovely and helpful the bar staff are useless, slow and incompetent they had to google how to make the cocktails from their own menu!  Needless to say I do not recommend this hotel We stayed at AB Paluso for 4 night nights. The room was well furnished and spacious with a view of the pool. We seemed to have stayed during low season, so we basically had the whole place to ourselves. The property has a lot of greenery, and its outside the city so traffic noise was very minimal, making it a very relaxing stay at the hotel.    We had most of our meals at the hotel restaurant, everything tasted great. The menu, while not too big, had enough variety to keep us from getting bored with the food. Breakfast wasn‚Äôt the usual buffet (maybe because only few guests were staying at the time), we just had to order what we wanted.    My daughter really enjoyed the pool. There‚Äôs also a gym room which is well equipped, and a spa, and conference room (which we didn‚Äôt use).    There is a nice bar area overlooking the pool, with a pool table and a foosball table for entertainment.    Also, there is a small shop within the hotel which had basic items you might need. There is also a 7/11 and BigC Mini within walking distance from the hotel.    The staff were very helpful and always greeted us with a smile.    We will be visiting again! Big and clean room. Smelt a little off. Swimming pool looked nice. Gym looked good too. Didn't get to use either. Breakfast was OK but basic. Service is OK. WiFi worked well. Mini bar well stocked. Nice enough place I came here twice and will definitely come back.  The room is clean and cozy, warm welcome. Totally recommend for family with kids.The Place is not in the crownded area and not really far from Pattaya beach. I came here twice already i love the enviroment around the hotel, food is very nice, the staff was very helpful and most of them can speak english so its very easy to communicate with them and the room is very nice and clean. Was really happy with the service,all staff have smiles to greet    The place was peacefully and quite Staff was so friendly and helpful starting from security outside until reception when ever m coming to pattaya I will sleep there and I will tell my friends about this nyc place Nice place for a weekend getaway. We enjoyed the facilities and quite atmosphere. Our daughter loved the kid center and wife enjoyed the spa, while I had a good time in the gym. We definitely will come back here. Thank you Hotel is newly renovated and well designed. Rooms are comfortable and very clean. I recommend to stay in those with pool view. There is a spa with very good massager. I highly recommend stay in AB Paluso. It's nice and quiet place to relax. I stayed there during Wonderfruit Festival in December 2017  Checked in at 7pm and left for the festival.  Arrived back at midnight to find NO ELECTRICITY AND NO WATER.  My room had no window only the one front door, so if I sleep with my door open either the mosquitoes or an intruder could kill me. So I waited for the electricity to come back for about 1-2 hours in the car until 2AM and there was still no sign of electricity I had to check out and find another hotel at 2AM!    In the morning i return to ask for the full refund which the manager agreed in verbal to not worry they will give me a refund for sure. The next day I called the hotel and they lied that they already contacted the bank for the refund so I waited for 30 days.    NO REFUND. THEY JUST LIED TO ME. So i contacted them through booking.com and they said they change their mind about the refund. So no refund for me because I used the facility (YES STAYED THERE FOR 2 HOURS WITH NO ELECTRICITY AND NO WATER.)    SO NO, DON'T STAT THERE IF YOU WANT A GOOD HOLIDAY BECAUSE THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE. There was a group of us staying for Wonderfruit festival. The pool area and pool side rooms were lovely and modern. Garden view rooms, which we all had were dated but comfortable! Bed sheets were not changed in 4 nights, which is bad when you have been dancing in a field for 3 days. 2 out of the 4 days, the room was even cleaned. Breakfast was cold each day and we had to ask them to get us cereal and fruit after they said there was none left. Pool service was slow and they dis nor bring cutlery or condiments with the food, we had to ask. If the cleaning and service was improved it would be a great place to stay. Impressive with places and surprisingly with their services. Lovely place with my recommendation. Their room are very new and beautiful. Besides this place provides you and things you need for vacation with your family; swimming pool, fitness area, restaurant with food and drinks and playroom for our kids. - Clean and very good service  - Has hotel facilities for kids  - Nice decoration  - Reasonable price    Remark: the resort is a bit far from Pattaya city. Recommended for people who is looking for a real retreat. The hotel is very clean.  All staff are polite, friendly and helpful.  I love a decorate room in this hotel and swimming pool.  It's so comfortable in this price.  It isn't expensive  This is my first time but I will come here again. Nice place with good location, near Lake Mabprachan also can drive to Pattya city. All facilities are well organize. We got upgrade from standard room.  All staff are nice, Comfy bed and get 4 complementary capsule per day. I have been here with my wife for business trip.The recepionist is so friendly.The room are more comfortable.Pool are salty pool which we can not found anymore in this area.breakfast are so good food.I will be back again for sure I came to this resort second time. It was very amazing resort near lake mabprachan pattaya. This is the place for people who want to relax and need quiet place. This price is very reasonable and include breakfast. Moreover, the resort also have many services such as spa , fitness room. If you looking for quiet place I highly recommend this resort. Very nice modern room, better than expectation. We stayed here for wonderfruit festival. It's very close to the site, only ten minutes away.    The pool is also very close to the rooms, only a few rooms available so very quiet.    Will definitely stay here again all the staffs are nice. feel like home. most important there isn't far frome Pattaya City just 15 mintues. the resort can not be find there is a location on google map. we here to attend WONDERFRUIT and there is near the event. lovely property and fantastic staff it has a lovely atmosphere and all the staff really helpful  i went to the festival wonderfruit and it is great location for this and I had amazing thai massage too great hotel thanks Popped in to this new resort , just 6 minutes from me.  Initially quite impressed, looked good and clean.  Restaurant and bar area are totally separate (good) and both are inside (good) and both are air conditioned (good).  Lovely pool and surrounding area, spotlessly clean.  Viewed a couple of rooms, (just to be nosey), more than acceptable.  Entered the bar area, played pool on a table that has seen better days!!  Asked for a Cocktail and a Chang.  The Cocktail when it eventually arrived (15 minutes), I felt was very ordinary and overpriced, 180 Bhat.  The Chang never materialised!!  After searching for 10 minutes or so, the barman informed me that they had no Chang and offered me a Leo!  I declined and asked for a glass of red wine instead.  ""No wine sir, sorry "".  Finished Cocktail, paid and left!!!!  Totally disappointed in what initially seemed a very nice place.  Feel sad for the owners/investors.  Someone has tried really hard to get people in and when they do arrive they let them down terribly.  I accept that this may be a new venture/ resort, however they need to organise and run things a lot better to survive.  I may pop back again in a month or so, just to check ????  In the meantime, if you visit?, I wish you better luck than what I had !! ‡∏ú‡∏°‡πÑ‡∏õ‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡πâ‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏•‡πâ‡∏ß‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö ‡∏ñ‡πâ‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ‡πÑ‡∏õ‡∏ò‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏á‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏´‡∏£‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏û‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏ú‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏ñ‡∏ß‡∏û‡∏±‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏≤ ‡∏Å‡πá‡∏ï‡∏±‡πâ‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏à‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡∏à‡∏∞‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏±‡∏ö‡πÑ‡∏õ‡∏≠‡∏µ‡∏Å ‡πÅ‡∏ï‡πà‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏à‡∏∞‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏´‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á Premier ‡∏î‡∏π‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏á ‡∏™‡πà‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏ß‡∏¥‡∏ß‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏ú‡∏°‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏î‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏•‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö  1)‡∏≠‡∏ò‡∏¥‡∏ö‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏ì‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö : Very Good / suitable for 4-5 star.  2)‡∏ö‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏ä‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏´‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏û‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏≠‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏£ : Very Clean & Good accessories inside the room.  3)‡∏ö‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡πà‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏µ‡πà‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏™‡∏ñ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏ï‡∏±‡πâ‡∏á & ‡∏™‡∏¥‡πà‡∏á‡∏≠‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏ß‡∏¢‡∏Ñ‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏™‡∏∞‡∏î‡∏ß‡∏Å : ‡πÉ‡∏Å‡∏•‡πâ‡∏≠‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏Å‡πá‡∏ö‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏ö‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ä‡∏±‡∏ô Pattaya & Fitness/Spa including the package(‡∏ï‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏ú‡∏°‡πÑ‡∏õ‡∏ô‡∏∞).  4)‡∏ö‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏¥‡πà‡∏á‡πÉ‡∏î‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏Ñ‡∏∏‡∏ì‡∏ä‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏î & ‡∏ä‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏î : Very like for Comfortable Bed & Cocktail Bar....Swimming pool.

Good location,isolated from city but not far from Pattaya city,by the car about 15 mins. me with my daughter came here feel it's good value of money,we can't find any hotel better than here by this rate,the owner Micheal was so hospitality,all staff so nice to us,as they not so much training before,but they like us feel at home. A different Pattaya, perfect for a young family: no red light atmosphere in front of the hotel, no traffic jam, no noise ...  In April we stayed in this small, cozy resort a bit out of town close to Siam Country Club and liked it very much. The perfect location for me as a golfer - every day another golf course, just few minutes away. Free Wifi all over the resort, so I could go online when I wanted without worrying about the cost. And when we wanted to go out in the evening, they provided a top babysitter (our little one loved her).  They have new management for 2 months and this is the best that happened to this hotel. They have renovated a lot, the service is good and friendly, live sport is shown on 2 screens in the pub, and the best: parties with BBQ in the garden for famous sport events which can be watched on Pattayas largest screen - either while sitting in the garden or from the swimming pool! Yes, you can swim, and still watch this huge screen ;-)  The rooms are nice and have large, comfortable beds, of course, air condition, minibar, etc. The prices in the restaurant are moderate, and the food is just great.  The best is the friendly and very personal management. The fulfilled our wishes whatever was possible. We had sent them a booking email and got a nice long staying discount. And the airport pickup in a BMW 7 limousine for only 2500 baht - amazing (the driver speaks really English).  By minibus you are in the center of Pattaya within 15 minutes, and it can even bring you to nice beaches south of Pattaya or to the ferryboat to Koh Larn.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.944608,100.979378&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.944608,100.979378|12.944608,100.979378&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.972740,100.976349|12.954542,100.909927|12.912810,100.939194|12.950742,100.937111|12.989520,100.925217|12.974793,100.976830|12.947508,100.954559|12.909728,100.944443|12.909081,100.917610&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890711,100.935692|12.908712,100.916000|12.939422,100.916946|12.918122,100.928093|12.961980,100.921494|12.920447,100.960480|12.924349,100.912750|12.936882,100.928726|12.906045,100.919914&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.986191,100.919518|12.947436,100.931625|12.912784,100.926170|12.962568,100.909744|12.975434,100.913986|12.948500,100.932617|12.971217,100.919937|12.942660,100.941483&signature=I-QCbVwe1CctdGt80xVJdXEFUZM=",1.0,Positive
3,"BUTTERFLY GARDEN BOUTIQUE RESIDENCE BY FRASIER - Updated 2022 Prices & Villa Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","I was traveling alone and got a huge apartment on the top of the building just for myself. It was clean and comfortable, also internet was strong so I could easily work from there. The location was in a quiet area and around 10 minutes walking from the beach. I could see the sunset from my terrace. Neang was working there during the day and was always very helpful and caring, she reacted directly if I had any questions or need some help. Thank you, Neang! Everything works and the two-bedroom apartment had everything I needed. Air conditioning works fine however you will be required to pay extra for the use of electricity as the quoata they give is not enough. Distance to travel anywhere should be considered and would not be a problem for somebody with their on transport, however without you will need to pay for additional transport. Place can be difficult to find however a telephone call to the venue enabled the taxi driver to find the place. Beds are comfortable swimming pool is small but adequate, area is safe. I was drawn to this place, while browsing the web for somewhere to stay in pattaya, and I'm glad I was , our room was superb, the place its self was absolutely fantastic, but for me , the best part was our host, her name was Naed and she was fantastic, I'd lost my passport in Bangkok and she let me use her phone to retrace it, also she organized a taxi for me to travel to Bangkok to get my passport back and then take us to our destination in Bangkok , if you own this place, she deserves a big thank you We have visited Thailand on 6 occasions, this apartment is by far the best we have stayed at, very clean, well equipped, very large and comfortable, good location, fairly quiet area, and the staff are brilliant especially Neang who we dealt with. We stayed for 12 nights and the rooms cleaned and bedding and towels changed on 3 occasions. Control the use of the air conditioning and you will find the free allowance covers the electricity used. Will definitely recommend and visit again. Very good vallid for money. 190 sq meters. 120 sq m living Room, 70 sq m bedrooms, 4 aircondition and 4 big fan. High speed internett. 5 meters from sw pool.  12 min from the beach, and 6 min walk to public taxi, clap your hands, and private taxi, pick u up, outside the gate. I booked a 2 bedroom apartment at Butterfly Garden Boutique Residence after reading good reviews about the place. When I arrived with my family we found that all the kitchen cabinet doors were missing and the interior of the apartment - apart from the large flat screen TV - would have been better placed inside a museum. The entire decor of the apartment was old (or some might say retro) and the kitchen looked a complete mess. On the plus side, the staff were extremely pleasant and and apologized for the state of the apartment. The owner - who is American - stated told me she had to have the work done in the kitchen because that was the only time that her workmen could fit the job in. Of course, she could have blocked the sale of the room off rather than renting it out in the state it was in. The rooms are very big and represent good value for money - although I would rather pay more to have a more modern place to stay. Having stayed in Thailand many time with my family the Butterfly Garden is by far the best place I‚Äôve stayed, the staff were very friendly and always happy to help. The accommodation I stayed in was a two bedroom apartment which was like home from home, everything from the air-con to the large TV was spot on, the internet was fast and never dropped out, the main bathroom had a large Jacuzzi hot tub which my little lad love, the swimming pool area is also very lovely surrounded by beautiful gardens. On our last day we were due to check out by 12noon but we weren‚Äôt being picked up for the airport until 4pm so the management team let us stay in the room till we got picked up free of charge which was a really kind of them. 4 adults and 1 child (10 year old) and we had plenty of space.  We will be coming back here again for sure.  Many thanks Butterfly Garden for such a wonderful stay New or near new furniture in all rooms, huge apartments with decks, great cable TV and modern television with YouTube apps built-in (great for kids), full size European style kitchen with 6 gas burners, I could go on...    Okay let's get the elephant in the room out of the way first. Yes they do charge for electricity but only if you go over the daily allowance.    My family of four stayed here for 10 days and we used the air conditioner in two rooms every days for hours, and we did not pay any extra for electricity.    I now understand why they charge for electricity. This is essentially a full modern residential apartment and our unit had FOUR air conditioning units, fans and many lights. If they didn't have this policy, unfortunately some guests would take advantage of it and leave all their air conditioners on all day long even when it is not occupied.    The only thing you need to be aware of is that they charge a security deposit from memory 3000 baht which you get back at the end of your stay if you haven't broken anything (which is often a nice surprise because you have already forgotten you spent it!).    And that they only accept cash not for any other reason than Thai banks make it almost impossible for independent hotel to get CC faciltiies, so make sure you know the total to pay and exchange the appropriate money before arriving or you could just walk to an ATM (about 6 mins away).    There are taxis at the end of the street about 75 metres away who can take you anywhere in Pattaya. No they do not use the meter, but that is normal. For your benefit here is what I paid after some negotiation:    150 BAHT - Royal Cliff Beach Resort (Close)  150 BAHT - Royal Garden Plaza (Central Pattaya)  150 BAHT - Harbor Mall (25 min drive)  200 BAHT - Central Pattaya (was feeling generous)    So although the main road where you can get a Songtaew is 600m (a 7 minute walk), you can easily get a taxi anytime for a fairly reasonable price.    Try getting the same quality of apartment closer to Central Pattaya for this price!    TIP 1: If you want good quality restaurant food close by visit Tara Court Hotel (600m). They also do takeaway.    TIP 2: The nearest convenience store is about 350M away.    TIP 3: There is a small Ma and Pa convenience store open during the day and early evening about 150M to grab snacks, beer etc.    TIP 4: When coming back in a taxi all you need to know is ""SOI 6 PRAHTUMNAK"" just learn how to say that and you will be fine, and shouldn't pay more than 200 baht anywhere in Pattaya to get back.    The pool area was lovely but didn't seem that utilised, and the gardens are lovely. This is a quiet area, very little noise inside the apartment.    Perfect for families, groups and even singles or couples as check out their 1 bedroom prices, ridiculously good value for money.    This area is essentially a suburb, with local amenities for residents and is not touristy at all. I went to Thailand in November 2016 for the first time as a solo traveler. I've been traveling by myself for years and I have been to over 40 countries, however this was the first time visiting Asia.    Being originally from Rio de Janeiro, I thought: ""Okay, English is not their first language here, but I'm sure I can communicate"". Surprisingly most Thailandese can't go any further than ""where you from?"", so I found it very hard to find information at the places I've stayed at, and the staff seemed mostly disinterested.    I was so lucky to have found Butterfly Garden Boutique Residence by Frasier! I wasn't sure what to expect, so initially I only booked 3 nights, but as soon as I walked into the property I went straight online and booked another 4 nights!    The place is amazing, it felt so good to finally be somewhere comfortable and welcoming. Not to mention the spa bath in the bathroom, what a treat... The owner, an American lady who has so much travel knowledge and willingness to help... She personally checked me in and out, helped me with tips about the area, suggested flights to Phuket and booked my transfer to the airport. I hope you are reading this because I want you to know that this kind of attitude is what makes a business successful.    Already planning my next visit and this time I will not waste time or money: will be staying here again, 100%. It is an apartment styled hotel. It boast of the Jetted Tub (jacuzzi), but it is broken and we can't do anything about it. Small tiny pool.    The caretaker was nice but she charges electricity. We only turn on one air conditioner and was still being charged.    The location is near the night market (huh?!? What night market? or you mean the small little food court?) wish i had stayed longer here biggest room or rooms as there was private bedrooms, fully functional kitchen, lounge room and dining room and great shower and private spa.  would be great place to stay for an extended holiday with the whole family, to keep costs down they do charge extra for electricity once you use over your allocated block.  i would stay here again. I was recently traveling in Thailand for the first time, on my own. I wanted to visit Pattaya, south of Bangkok, both to be near the beach and because I like places where there are more Europeans and Asians than Americans. I found this place called Butterfly Garden, which I loved. Stayed for 4 days, in a 2-bedroom condo. The setting is behind locked filigreed gates (as a woman alone, I appreciated that security), through which you enter into a little paradise of a well-kept garden of flowering trees and plants. At the center is a lovely pool. Each unit seems like a world unto itself: mine had its own little gate, a private patio with high walls where I was totally invisible to others, and sliding doors into the very spacious unit. All the dishes and tools I‚Äôd need to cook for myself were in the kitchen, as well as a basket of toiletries and plenty of towels in the bathroom. There were 4 different A/C units, so I could keep the living room cooler and the bedrooms a little warmer. Beds were comfortable with firm mattresses and plenty of pillows, and there was plenty of closet and drawer space. Shower was very modern. Unit was spotlessly clean. Jill the manager was a total delight: a warm, funny and totally helpful lady who seemed to know the answer to every single question I had. The restaurants she suggested were all terrific. The Thai staff were quiet, efficient and unobtrusive. Location is great as well: near all the shops including places to buy food to cook, easy walk to the beach, but totally quiet and almost ‚Äòcloistered‚Äô. I regret I didn‚Äôt plan to stay longer, but I hope to return next year on my way to other sights in Thailand that I didn‚Äôt get to on this trip.

4,"CASAVIVA INN HOTEL AND CONDOMINIUMS - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya) - Tripadvisor","Cheep and cheerful accommodation great value for Money.  Rooms cleaned on a daily Basis, and fresh clean towels daily although the towels are a Little old.  free wifi is available in all rooms along with Airconditioning, fridge and a safe.    less than a minuet walk from the beach and convenience stores and Restaurants.  excursions can be booked at the Hotel reception desk by the friendly owners who speak several languages.  i would definately return to this Hotel. I stayed in the dormitory room at this hotel. It was very clean and I had the whole room to myself. I would fully recommend this hotel as a place to stay. The staff were all really nice, friendly and helpful. Located right next to the beach and about a 5 minute walk from the night market. The proprietors are a lovely helpful couple, they know everything you need to know about where to go and what there is to do. It's very handy for the beach and they supply you with beach towels. Everything you need like chemist, super market etc is on the door step. The rates are very reasonable and speaking to others that where staying at the Casa Viva say they've stayed before and they'll be staying again. If we are lucky enough to get back to Thailand we would stay there again. Not a bad little spot at all, we definitely recommend it. I have stayed at Casa viva many times as its a good hotel at Jomtien close to all the action in Pattaya- a short 10min baht bus drive away.    The rooms are all modern with comfortable beds and aircon.    The reception and cleaning staff are all friendly.    Sometimes the wifi is unreliable at casaviva but they always sort it out when advised. This lovely little place is only 1 minute from the beach. The comfortable rooms are spotless, cleaned every day with clean sheets and towels daily, king size beds. Everything you need within walking distance. Free wi-fi and an adjoining coffee shop for breakfast.. Run by a very friendly and helpful couple, nothing is too much trouble for them. Highly recommended. Please, if you want a good, clean hotel with super friendly and helpful staff, then this is it, so central to everything, only 20 baht on baht bus to Pattaya. We will definately be going back and referring Na mon and Pierre to all our friends and fellow travellers. Also free WiFi and plenty of good and inexpensive little food outlets, the best by far was 'The Garage' Casaviva is along Beach Road, Jomtien near Soi 12 and 50 meters from the sea. ‚Ç¨250 per month rooms cleaned everyday and free Wi-Fi. Very nice rooms to a good standard and the area is very quite. Walk to the end of the soi and you can walk either way along 8 km of sandy beach. Plenty of places to eat and lots of 7/11's along the way. If you want the madness of Pattaya it's a ‚Ç¨0.30 20 minute ride. They also run 24/7 and are safe to travel on. Will come back here again without doubt real value for money and the A/C is first class. We arrived having been stranded due to the volcano ash and not knowing where to go and asked the taxi driver to take us somewhere quiet, cheap and close to the beach - he took us to Casaviva Inn - we were impressed with the cleanliness and reserved a large room which was very spacious with a huge bed, tv, aircon, fridge and wifi connection. The bathroom was ample with walk in shower. No food is supplied but plenty of places to grab a bite locally. Pierre was most helpful and could direct you to where you wanted to go and knew the answer to all of our questions. You can get your laundry done just up the road, supermarket just a few steps away and the beach is close. My family have just arrived back from an unexpected stay at the Casaviva Inn hotel. We were delayed because of the Volcanic Ash problem which delayed our return to the UK. We arrived at Pattaya bus station and ask the taxi driver to take us to somewhere clean, cheap and quiet. He did just that. We arrived and was given a large room 302 on the third floor. There was myself, my husband and my 8 year old son. We were impressed with the cleanliness and size of the room. The hotel also has free internet access. You can also use the computer in reception free of charge. The hotel is also very close to Jomtien beach. The husband and wife team are very helpful especially in answering questions on places of interests and costs of trips etc. The only thing I would add to the rooms is a small table and chairs. Otherwise the room is very adaquate. There is no swimming pool but I took my son to the Saritta hotel which is opposite and if you buy a drink they don't mind you using the pool. There are also a Family Mart close by and a laundry service next door. I been in south pattaya Jomtien beach.  And i get a very good and nice hotell, very near beach.

Web sites  www.casavivainn.weebly.com  check out for this good nice hotell. you not gonna be disappointed. My Wife and I stayed at the casaviva Inn. It is described as a Chonburi Hotel but is actually in Jomtien Beach. We arrived early and that was no problem. Got a great room, large, clean and with everything you could want. The bathroom was spotless and that is always a good sign. The staff was particularly attentive and gave us great help with local activities and shopping tips. It is less that a minute walk to the beach. For the rates this hotel represent exelent value and we will stay there again. Cheep and cheerful accommodation great value for Money.  Rooms cleaned on a daily Basis, and fresh clean towels daily although the towels are a Little old.  free wifi is available in all rooms along with Airconditioning, fridge and a safe.    less than a minuet walk from the beach and convenience stores and Restaurants.  excursions can be booked at the Hotel reception desk by the friendly owners who speak several languages.  i would definately return to this Hotel. I stayed in the dormitory room at this hotel. It was very clean and I had the whole room to myself. I would fully recommend this hotel as a place to stay. The staff were all really nice, friendly and helpful. Located right next to the beach and about a 5 minute walk from the night market. The proprietors are a lovely helpful couple, they know everything you need to know about where to go and what there is to do. It's very handy for the beach and they supply you with beach towels. Everything you need like chemist, super market etc is on the door step. The rates are very reasonable and speaking to others that where staying at the Casa Viva say they've stayed before and they'll be staying again. If we are lucky enough to get back to Thailand we would stay there again. Not a bad little spot at all, we definitely recommend it. I have stayed at Casa viva many times as its a good hotel at Jomtien close to all the action in Pattaya- a short 10min baht bus drive away.    The rooms are all modern with comfortable beds and aircon.    The reception and cleaning staff are all friendly.    Sometimes the wifi is unreliable at casaviva but they always sort it out when advised. This lovely little place is only 1 minute from the beach. The comfortable rooms are spotless, cleaned every day with clean sheets and towels daily, king size beds. Everything you need within walking distance. Free wi-fi and an adjoining coffee shop for breakfast.. Run by a very friendly and helpful couple, nothing is too much trouble for them. Highly recommended. Please, if you want a good, clean hotel with super friendly and helpful staff, then this is it, so central to everything, only 20 baht on baht bus to Pattaya. We will definately be going back and referring Na mon and Pierre to all our friends and fellow travellers. Also free WiFi and plenty of good and inexpensive little food outlets, the best by far was 'The Garage' Casaviva is along Beach Road, Jomtien near Soi 12 and 50 meters from the sea. ‚Ç¨250 per month rooms cleaned everyday and free Wi-Fi. Very nice rooms to a good standard and the area is very quite. Walk to the end of the soi and you can walk either way along 8 km of sandy beach. Plenty of places to eat and lots of 7/11's along the way. If you want the madness of Pattaya it's a ‚Ç¨0.30 20 minute ride. They also run 24/7 and are safe to travel on. Will come back here again without doubt real value for money and the A/C is first class. We arrived having been stranded due to the volcano ash and not knowing where to go and asked the taxi driver to take us somewhere quiet, cheap and close to the beach - he took us to Casaviva Inn - we were impressed with the cleanliness and reserved a large room which was very spacious with a huge bed, tv, aircon, fridge and wifi connection. The bathroom was ample with walk in shower. No food is supplied but plenty of places to grab a bite locally. Pierre was most helpful and could direct you to where you wanted to go and knew the answer to all of our questions. You can get your laundry done just up the road, supermarket just a few steps away and the beach is close. My family have just arrived back from an unexpected stay at the Casaviva Inn hotel. We were delayed because of the Volcanic Ash problem which delayed our return to the UK. We arrived at Pattaya bus station and ask the taxi driver to take us to somewhere clean, cheap and quiet. He did just that. We arrived and was given a large room 302 on the third floor. There was myself, my husband and my 8 year old son. We were impressed with the cleanliness and size of the room.

5,CENTURY PATTAYA HOTEL - Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"Away from the hectic and perhaps sleazy Bar area, the Century Pattaya Hotel is a quiet, pleasant place to stay. This hotel is a little old and has definitely seen better days. The rooms are larger than most and are serviced daily with clean linen and a good clean through of the room. I have stayed at more up market hotels in Pattaya and have not received service of this quality. I remember one more expensive hotel, we struggled to get our room made up at all.  Breakfast is automatically served as an ""American Breakfast"" it comes with weird little sausages and ham with eggs, I suggest you request the vegetarian option with noodles or fried rice, it's much nicer.  The swimming pool is due for restoration and has many lost broken tiles, currently it is swim at your own risk. We swam daily being very careful of the edges and bottom of the pool.  The staff are lovely and there are many pleasant restaurants and street stalls close by. Century is situated between 2 large shopping centres within walking distance. There are many dentists in the area and you can get early appointments without difficulty. I have used a couple of these facilities and been very happy with the service and the results. I highly recommend this hotel if you want am appropriate quiet place not next door to a bar but within walking distance if required. Very few guests in the hotel, it seemed. Very run-down and in need of maintenance and repair. Pool in very bad condition. Good value for what I paid, though. Front desk staff friendly and helpful. Convenient location on Central Pattaya Road. Markets, Big C hypermarket and beach within walking distance. i think this hotel its very bad i see. sound like a horror music when i entered. the toilet so dark. . for to traveling this hotel i recomend to not sleep at here. this place is not suitable for overnight stay We visit the hotel as a part of tour package, and i must say this place is not recommended at all.. It looks spooky from the outside during night since they only turn on the light for certain places.. We arrive at night and the hotel lobby looks empty, the lift only fit for 4 person max, the room is quite big though with some old furniture, maybe it was a good hotel back in days, but now.. Very poor, no wifi, the breakfast option is so limited, especially for muslim traveler.. It had a swimming pool also with no lifeguard on duty.. The Location is far from the beach, so its very quite.. Only stay here for one night. The breakfast was okay although not many choices available. The padthai was good but limited and they didn't fill the empty tray though we asked for it. At night many stalls open with alot of variety of Thailand foods and the best one was on the street in line with this hotel down to the beach the best Mango Sticky Rice I'd ever have. Only 60B per portion and enough for two person. Hot and dark no AC, no lights in lobby or hallway. The whole place is old, smells and not clean. They should close the place down and fix it up before charging so much money. It is a very old place and shouldn't pass quality inspection.  Terrible place to stay. We moved out he next day because we have already check in so we couldn't leave the day of. I stayed a night in this hotel. Its an average old hotel. Old interiors, the bathroom's door is rotten in some spots, and making some noisey.  Breakfast is beyond average, asian type of food with a bit of toast, sausage ( for western options ) i guess. Wifi is not free, paid 50bath for 60mins and cant walk to Restaurant to have breakkie cos the wifi range is limited. Not exactly the Dusit Thani but nonetheless a very pleasant stay. Although in need of good lick of paint the rooms are spacey and clean with a very good maid service. Hotel staff are friendly and very helpful plus most speak English. If you want some where cheap and cheerful (¬£12 per night) that's very close to shopping, nightlife and the beach, then look no further. Well this place is having an old-fashioned desigend but well still quite cozy; eventho the lobby when i arrived was really hot and dark. Since the hotel quite old but the atmosphere still nice and I love the fact that its really close to the market night.. But quite far to the bar. stayed for a night. with a budget tour.  its fine to just rest , sleep and leave in the morning.    Bad Point :  NO free wifi.  Dark , hot , smell corridor.  Old with not much improvement.    good point :  near night market along the central pattaya road. Need renovation  The hotel is old  Not dirty but not really comfortable staying there  The hotel corridor i think is a little bit creepy  The corridor is a bit too empty hot and a bit dark  And the other room electricity is a bit broken i guess  Hit the lamp button and the lights near door are out i stayed here just for a night, the hotel condition is not good, there are not many guests stayed here. the hotel need improvement and renovation, and there are also some horror stories that my friends shared with me. luckily i am not experience the same thing, and there is also no wifi Only location is very good near so many shop houses, and room is spacious and also we can enjoy the view of Pattaya from balcony.    However, bad thing is no wifi at hotel. Only possible if we can buy wifi cards that provides wifi per hour only. No boiler in room and no toothbrush provided. Other than that, hotel is just average. A better rating just for its good location. The air conditioner was not working properly, I even saw a cockroach running around the table when I had my breakfast. But the foods was fine.  Please note that this hotel doesn't provide a free wifi service, you need to pay if you want to use their wifi.  The staffs didn't even try to greet us to at least say ""good morning"". This old hotel is looks very old. Not so many visitors stay in this hotel. Not a very good choice if you can choose another hotel. I stay here because it comes in my tour package and it seems all visitors also stays here due to its tour arrangement.    By it looks, this hotel seems to be a 4 star hotel in 1990's. But it badly need restoration.    Location was not bad, some 15-20 mins walk to the beach and it is on the main road where every kind of shops, restaurants, massages, bars are around.    The room itself was also old but ok. beware, no wifi at hotel's room.    For hotel's management: sorry, but it can be better I stayed for two nights here. I had no worry about halal food since they provided the Indian vegetarian ones on the breakfast menu. With only few hundred meters away from the beach, I could take a morning walk to the beach, enjoyed the refreshing air and the street market foods. My bus was trapped by the electric cables which not well arranged by hung it to low to the ground and it was dangerous in the hotel entrance.    It was a old hotel which its glory had been passed, lack of renovation, and lack of facilities such as a free wifi.    But, I do like their breakfast ... a hot plain chicken rice soup ... and, last but not least, it was located near by the beach (10 minutes walking distance), hard rock cafe (30 minutes walking distance), and night life around the hotel. An old hotel and The breakfast was not good enough.  There's a good swimming pool at the hotel.  The area around the hotel is condusive and there are several minimarts nearby.  Going to several tourist sites are not difficult from there and I think the location is good I stayed here during a Bangkok-Pattaya tour package so the hotel charge was part of the amount we paid for the package and I don't know how much it was, but it must be cheap. The room was spacious and I don't complaint about cleanness, but I can hardly give any compliments either. I think this is a budget hotel which is a favorite address of tour operators, and offers very basic, standard services. I would not come back here if I am in a position to book the hotel by myself. Bad service, not friendly. Dirty rooms. The worst hotel in the world. The manager is not friendly. I paid my laundry service and they did not give me the correct change. They tried to steal my money. The food is not well cooked. The restaurant personal is not friendly. This hotel is really old. The furniture is broken. The windows doesn't work. The towels are old and everything cost like if were made of gold. We stayed at this hotel overnight as part of the Pattaya tour package we booked in Bangkok. The room is quite spacious and clean but since it‚Äôs very old it has this bizarre smell. The walls are thin so you can hear people‚Äôs voice from the other rooms. The staff are not at all friendly and can barely speak English. I don‚Äôt recommend this hotel at all. Stayed at this hotel on 14/15 of jan 2011. The room was very basic the TV has no reception no face towel just 2 very old towels.On our departure day we were accused of stealing their towels we told them to take a better look. Then they came back and said one of the towels was dirty ( it had a a bit of makeup on it) and was told to pay 300B. How absurd arent towels suppose to get dirty , isnt it their job to wash towels? Staff were very unfriendly and racist towards Cambodians. Went there in a tour this month, my advice stay away from this hotel. Service was terrible. I went there in a group tour, as we are checking out, one of the staff was checking the rooms, then came back and said that there was a towel missing from a room, so they were asking for payment for the towel, I asked the people in the bus whether anyone's probably took the towel and left it in other room, one girl said that she took a towel from her room and left it in her mum's room so I told that to the staff, and asked them to checked the mum's room. Sure enough, they already know that there were 3 towels in the other room. Not getting money from that scenario, they again told me to pay up because one of the towel was real dirty. So I asked them what's the problem with that, aren't they going to wash the towels anyway? why should i pay for the dirty towel? They say it's real dirty and damaged, so I told them I want to see it, they bring it down to me, and there was only this one dark spot (make-up spot). So I told them that it was only make-up spot, which will be gone once it's being washed, but they still insist that I pay 300baht for it. Oh even my tour guide was telling us when we check in to make sure that the Tv's working, all appliances are in good working condition, check that there are 2 towels in the room and nothing in the room's broken..    My advice, stay away from this hotel, the cheap price's not worth all the trouble. generally speaking, it was the worst hotel i've ever slept.  i've been to many cheap hotels/,motels in most places, but this 'hotel' is just not up to standard.  i am not expecting high-end services, but with the rotten-smell room and peel out carpet,it was just not comfortable at all. not to mention the bathroom has only one wall-light, not the ceiling one, it was so hard to see clearly when you taking a shower.  so my suggestion is to pay a little bit more to get a better motel/hotel.  PS. i paid $1500THD/per night in DEC2010 very nice place...nice room..very clean..your pay for what you get..as in its nice and clean..and good FOOD..buffet food is always good..a lot of choices.. Walking in the Hotel there is a Wheelchair Ramp, what is Great. The place has Lifts what is Excellent. But the thing is, We was Located on the 7th Floor, there is 8 floors to the Building. But we took my Grandmother to Pattaya and she has had a Stroke and not good on feet, shes 80 years old, now being located on the 7th floor is not good as if there was a Fire, there is no good Escape for her! and also if the Lift was Broken she couldn't manage the Stairs. Shower dosnt have enough Grab Handles. The Shower is Rubbish its one that is on the Taps. lol. But you have to make do.    The Hotel was great, the Food wasnt good for English! If you want a nice Breakfast go to ""Robins Nest-urant"" its not too far about 10-15 minutes"" Tuk-Tuk can drop you off there within about 5 minutes. Its very Central near all Shops. Quite far from Walking Street though.    Overall the Hotel is Very clean. Basic room and Air Condition wasnt the Best! but best thing to do is Leave it on all the time while out (But some Cleaners turn it off) then you end up Walking into a Sauna Room lol. So Leave on your Air Con & Hope they don't turn it off. Swimming Pool is Great and Big. Beach is down the Road, 10-15 minute walk.    Our main concern was, No good for Disabled people. We asked for a Lower Ground floor before we went, they said it was Full. We asked to Move and we couldn't. This is my 2nd time staying in this decent ok hotel - so there wasn't any surprise. Everything came in within expectations. Room is basic, clean and roomy. The condition is worn out but consider acceptable. Breakfast is ok - sausages, egg and some Thai-style breakfast. Location is in city centre and conveniently located along the main street with plenty of shops and foodstalls.    Don't mind to go back again if on tight budget. Fantastic hotel, great location, rooms cleaned everday, aswell as linnen.  breakfast ok, staff fantastic what more can i say!  Cheap too! book this hotel if ou want great value for money! The price is good at this place, but there are downsides.    They are not well located. A newcomer only figures out the bahtbus late in the visit and bahtbusses that go the length of pattaya are on beach and 2nd road. Both of those are some significant walking distance away on very poor and uneven sidewalks so you have to do some walking every single time you want to get anywhere at all and the sidewalks generate twisted ankles.    The breakfast buffet is good and included in the price. The staff is good and they care, but when any sort of question arises at the front desk the more senior and experienced people there are referred to and they always choose to gouge in price for something, anything. They arranged a taxi for me back to the airport and priced it at 1200 baht, which was fair. On the morning of departure, however, they informed me that price did not include tolls on the highway and to include them would be another 300 baht. I added the tolls up enroute and they were 120.    I know it's a poor country, but there's no call for this. If they need more money just price it that way.    Mixed experience overall. If you are a veteran of pattaya and are comfortable on the dangerous motorbike taxis the location issue goes away and all will probably be well.    Oh, one more thing. They gave me a room with a weak air con. It just wasn't cooling the room well. I complained and was moved, but they didn't believe me about the air con. The 2nd room was better. I later saw staff with freon testing gizmos in the elevator so they do clearly have an ongoing activity dealing with their air con. OTOH, they have the staff with the equipment trying to address the problem.    So there it is. If you are a veteran of Pattaya the price here is excellent value, given their excellent breakfast. If you are new, I would recommend somewhere else, closer to the beach road and farther towards Jomtien.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.933440,100.895813&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.933440,100.895813&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.933389,100.897560|12.933435,100.897408|12.934221,100.897774|12.933457,100.897423|12.934503,100.891907|12.932400,100.898849|12.932500,100.898972|12.934280,100.891502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.932719,100.898758|12.934425,100.893944|12.933379,100.898888|12.933244,100.896919|12.932694,100.896362|12.933247,100.898804|12.936825,100.893097|12.935522,100.896263|12.933944,100.899139&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.934105,100.897156|12.932687,100.895325|12.934375,100.897049|12.932275,100.892761|12.935860,100.893181|12.934711,100.892021|12.933580,100.897118|12.935577,100.896049|12.935827,100.898621&signature=L49gWcE5NdecU8laEyeiec-1A-k=",0.9994,Positive
6,"CHADA THAI HOUSE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","We found chada thai house on trip adviser and all the reviews we read where spot on.  Firstly the reception staff where out standing (preaw and nan ) so helpful friendly.  The location is central and close to everything, the rooms are very clean and tidy, the bed was very comfortable, there was no noise from music or parties when in the room.  Value for money is excellent  Location excellent  Rooms excellent  Staff absolutely excellent. Great motel in a very quiet setting, close to all the action and the beach and shopping centers are a stroll away, very clean and a relaxing atmosphere with a great balcony for eating and drinking, not a huge motel which is a nice change from the normal huge stays At the end of a dead end soi so quiet for location in centre of Pattaya. Laundry next door. Good service and comfortable rooms with balconies. Good value. Close to all the main attractions. Good bar at end of soi and 7/11 just around the corner. Very clean. Unpretentious. Location of Hotel in second road.Just in the middle of pattaya close to walking street .Very helpfull staff ,just wi-fi is slow.  Close to shopping malls .Thats my 3 th time there..  You may have day trip to Coral islands just ten minutes walk to harbour.. Lived in here during the stay in Pattaya at May 2013.  Located in the dead end of small street next to the second road (25 minutes walking to walking street), with small laundry right next to it and few bars.  Room was cozy, with all necessary furniture including big wardrobe.  The hotel didn't have a pool. We did a lot of online hotel hunting & finally we booked this hotel and bingo, we got what we wanted. Me and my friends stayed here for 3N.    The hotel is located at the end of an alley. Just outside there are 2 7eleven around the corner. The hotel is quiet considering that it's located in Pattaya.    Pattaya sleeps very late and there is loud music everywhere but you will not hear loud music once the doors are closed. Hotel is very close to beach road, walking street, local market, taxi stand & other important places.    Room was very clean, ventilated, big and comfortable. Beds were soft and comfortable. The receptionist girls & the staff was very friendly. They were also very helpful in giving us directions and helping us out in anything we needed. For the price we paid, we were very satisfied.    If am visiting Pattaya again, this is the place am staying in. This is definitely the most under rated hotel in Pattaya. Amazing location: 5 mins walk to the beach. Less than 10 mins walk to Ripleys, Mike shopping mall and Walking street. There's heaps of bars around and also 5 mins walk to Pattaya Night Market.  The room was spacious and clean with a balcony. The bed was very comfortable and I had a really good sleep all my 3 nights. The bathroom was perfect and super clean. The staff was very polite and very well spoken. Room service was great and the room was cleaned very well each day.  You won't regret booking your stay here. Great location at the end of the soi,nice and quite .nice size rooms, comfy beds 2 minutes walk to the beach, right near all the shops and bars, stayed many times great place.i like rooms up high, they have a lift so there is no problem there, the staff are good to, have balconys with rooms to. We walked in without a reservation after we had seen this hotel online and they offered us even a cheaper price than expected:)  And the room was great! Pretty big with everything in it that you need, very comfortable bed and a nice balcony with a table to sit at.    Hotel is located right in the center of pattaya at the end of a sideroad. This location could not be better, because this way you are able to walk everywhere but also get to sleep well in the very quiet room where you can not hear any noices from the bars when you close the window.    Also staff is very friendly and the hotel looks very nice, havent seen any other cute hotels in pattaya!  Anyway pattaya is not a nice city, worst place i have seen in thailand! So this hotel is the only nice place in pattaya;) Stayed here for one night, although this is a nice little hotel its situated at the end of an alley way with rubbish on either side, the location of the hotel itself is good near all the nightlife, friendly staff, room had the most comfortable bed and great bathroom, wi-fi very good however there was a smell of damp in our room and overlooked a rubbish site, no meal option in this hotel. We wouldn't stay here again. You wouldn't believe you were amongst all the nightlife when you stay here. The hotel is so quiet yet 2 mins walk away is the hustle and bustle of Soi Dianna and LK Metro.  I've stayed in Pattaya over 20 times and I can honestly say this is the best hotel I've had in 10 year.  The staff are always smiling and it's a traditional Thai style hotel, no western culture to be seen which is a bonus when you in Thailand, the whole hotel was spotless and modern.  It seemed to have couples and single people staying when I was there but you hardly ever see anyone cos the hotel only has 20 rooms over 5 floors so it's very private.  Never stayed at the same place twice in Pattaya but I think that's just changed.  Well Done Thai Chada House!!! Top spot if you are looking for digs in Pattaya for 1000 baht a night even in high season. Honestly didn't want to review this place in case it puts its prices up! On a side street off second road near soi, 2 minutes walk from the centre of the madness but it really feels out of the hustle and bustle. Basic rooms as you would expect, staff very friendly, not much more to say, only that I will be back, which is my highest recommendation. This is possibly the only 100 baht a night place in Pattaya that gets the reviews it gets in the numbers it gets. Stayed at the chada for 2 weeks very good experience staff so helpful hotel very clean and quiet I would highly recommend.Good location for beach and walking street also shops are nearby many places to eat very central location.All said a very good place to stay Stayed here for 5 nights in December 2014.  Greeted with a big smile by the owner, in fact he smiled every time we met.  Room was very clean and the bed so soft and comfortable. The bathroom was beautiful with quality shower and decor. And a little balcony outside with table and chairs for chilling out.  Good location, only 2 minute walk to Second Road but just far enough away for a quiet nights sleep. Beach Road about a 5-10 minute walk.  Lovely place and friendly staff.  Only reason for not giving 5 stars ... thin curtains so bright in the morning. Blackout curtains would be better. A lovely little hotel situated down a street which is only a 5 minute walk to the beach and 10 to the Main Street of nightlife. Hotel rooms lovely, spacious and clean and it had a nice balcony. Staff very helpful and friendly. The hotel was cheap and such a bargain for the price! we booked this hotel the night before travelling down for three days from bangkok. we saw all the good reviews and couldnt belive that it cost ¬£8 each per night !! what a steal.  This hotel is great,the rooms are fantastic and spacious and were only really just below par with my 4* hotel in BKK !  we stayed in room 213,was a great twin room with a balcony.  the hotel is set within tress at the end of the road and looks very nice,it is a 5-10 min walk up to walking street but that makes it a quiet location.  the staff were very friendly with us and helped us out on our return to Bangkok.  i still cant believe we stayed in such a nice hotel for such a low price.  I would recommend this hotel very highly. I have spent one night in this small hotel, tucked away from the bustling Second Road, at the end of a Soi. Nice people at reception desk, elevator, beautiful bedroom decorated with Thai style furniture, flat screen TV with international channels, large and comfortable bed (effectively, as told by a previous contributor, the pillows are rather big, but no problem for me). and a large balcony with table and benchs.  No breakfast was served (but in was 1st of May, which may be the reason). Several options nearby make the deal.  A lot of restaurants and shops around, and the famous Villa Market supermarket at 3 minutes walk.  A very good experience at a correct price. Tucked down the end of soi 14 off second road, this little place is a quiet oasis near to all the major attractions. Comfy bed, clean bathroom, even a balcony with tables and chairs outside. I haven't had to take a motorcycle taxi anywhere as you can walk to the beach in about 5 min, 15 min to walking street or central festival. There are about 20 rooms and it seems to be family run, with helpful staff. Try and get a high floor for a bit better view. for 1200 baht per night, you can't go wrong. I have to admit when we booked into this hotel I did not get a warm and fuzzy feeling. But it certainly grew on us and have to admit for a 3 or less star accommodation it was fantastic. Now keep in mind that they have breakfast but I can not speak to it as we were out every morning for breakfast as there were so many places around.  This hotel is located at the end of the street and from our room we could see the pool at the Areca Lodge, just over the wall and adjacent. The only thing we did not like was the place next door, which was a very dirty residence of some kind with lots of garbage around and very suspicious looking characters. What a pity as it really ruined the street to be honest but not a reflection at all on this hotel.  Staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs, whether day or night. We were on the fifth floor and the room was more than pleasant with a great bed. Laundry facilities were a couple of doors over just outside the hotel and from what we saw, probably the best rate with some awesome people working there.  And as I mentioned very central and convenient to the malls, bars and restaurants. it would have been nice to have a pool...but no complaints as we went to the beach. In fact we booked elsewhere in Pattaya for the last leg of our trip but in retrospect would have preferred to stay here. Management and staff were absolutely outstanding in every way! The decor is quaint old Thai style. It's very clean. You can easily walk to everywhere, including the beach, yet it is on one of the FEW quiet streets in town. The staff is so friendly.    It's the best hotel in this price range in Pattaya. Sigh.    But it's not very big. Sigh.    So by reviewing this place, I suppose now I will never be able to book a room at my favorite hotel again.    So please don't stay here.    Go somewhere else.    Thanks. Excellent small hotel tucked down the end of a lane,situated next to the large Intimate Hotel (formerly Tim Boutique).Chada Thai is quite charming.A decent sized bedroom with wooden floors,modern bathroom with a good shower with quality fittings.The bed,well once you have slept on some of the rock hard slabs in Pattaya you will really appreciate this one.Large LCD tv,with fast internet in the room.Small balcony with a table & a couple of chairs.Balcony's are attached to each other though so not the last word in privacy.The only criticism I have is that the sun shines through the curtains in the morning,they could do with a double set.But on the plus side,the room was super quiet,quite an achievement in crazy Pattaya,and not to be underestimated.A laundry is right outside the door,handy.Friendly staff that don't intrude,the maid seems to be cleaning continuously,and a big plus point is they don't use walkie talkies that can wake you up,they don't bang on your door all the time to clean the room,and because there are only 20 rooms,doors don't bang all night.Pricewise it is on the fringe of getting pricey as there is no pool,but highly recommended nonetheless! The hotel is nice, clean and the rooms are good. The room has a great bathroom with plenty of hot water and more pressure than most other places I have stayed in Thailand. The hotel is a little hard to find if you do not know the area but once found you will see how easy it is to access and how close it is to the action. There is a nice flat screen tv in the room. The curtains are not the black out type and there is a lot of building going up within a few hundred metres of the hotel so if you are a light sleeper then maybe it is not for you. It is a very small hotel with only 20 rooms but that was a bonus because in the 11 nights I was there I only saw other guests 2 times and the hotel was full. The hotel is guest friendly and the elevator is the first thing that you see when you enter the hotel. It was no issue anyway as I was there with my Thai g/f. I will stay there again even though there is no pool or restaurant. The shower makes up for that, it is large and fits 2, lol. Nice hotel to stay, we stayed for 3 nights. The location was good as it is off the main street just enough. The rooms are clean and the bathroom is very nice! The staff was very helpful. The only problem we had was that the AC was broke in our first room and they turned on the AC in 3 other rooms and let us pick which room we wanted to switch to. Overall I was really satisfied. They will also give you a good discount if you stay during low season. I will return back to this hotel when I come back to Pattaya in June and July. Me and a friend stayed here for 2 nights. The hotel is located at the end of an alley. There is another big hotel along the alley and just outside are 2 7eleven around the corner. The hotel is quiet considering that it's located in Pattaya. You will not be able to hear loud music throughout the night once the doors are closed. Few minutes walk down one lane to the main beach and about 10 minutes walk to walking street.    Room was big and comfortable. Beds were soft and the whole place was very clean. The receptionist girls was very friendly and loan us her handphone when we wanted to call a local Thai friend. They were also very helpful in giving us directions and helping us out in anything we needed. For the price we paid, we were very satisfied. I would definitely stay here again.    The only 2 things was that the hotel will charge 3% for payment with credit card and there are lots of mosquitoes around, be sure to bring insect repellent. very nice hotel to stay, we stayed for 2 nights. very good location, clean room, service nothing to complain, overall satisfied. just a min walk to main road, 2 min walk to beach, 10 min walk to walking street. we had very satisfied stay here Nice little hotel tucked away at the back of an alley. Clean rooms, soft beds and pillows (sometimes hard to find in Asia), excellent water pressure and hot water. Hotel staff not professional like 4 Seasons, but friendly. Whilst waiting for rooms to be cleaned the front desk clerk Noi served us cold water and bananas.    A bit quieter than most places in this area -- could not hear the thumping music late at night over the AC.    Would stay here again. Excellent value for the money. We were confronted by the female Basil Faulty of Thailand! This woman has to be the worst front of house person we have ever met. It totally spoilt our stay. Having said that the room was nicely furnished and a very comfy bed. The internet was useless and the hotel is being misleading by advertising such. Do not leave your key with the reception as the office is unattended most of the time and the keys are left in full view. We found the night staff and the cleaner to be excellent, friendly and helpful. I would not recommend this place as there are far too many other hotels where you won't be made to feel unwelcome. Lovely rooms, and they are nicer than the photos believe it or not, feels like a 4 star hotel, not 3!! Nice and quiet bathrooms are done to a high standard, do not hesitate coming here, 1 minute walk to second road, where u come out at beach roads soi 12, so very handy location too! For 28 Aussie dollars a night bargain!!    Free wifi in room which I'm on now,  Beds amazingly comfortable for a hotel!  LCD tv 32 inch    Will definately be returning A quaint little place at the end of a dead end Soi. Nicely furnished modern rooms with beautiful linen and an oh so comfortable beds. The shower room is excellent and so are all the fixtures and fittings.  I would rate this as more of a couples hotels as opposed to one suited for a single guy out to enjoy the delights of Pattaya's hedonistic lifestyle with different partners.  The staff are excellent and could not do enough for me and were always asking me if there was anything more they could do to make my stay more enjoyable. i was in pattaya in recent november 21, 2011 and after searching many hotels , i didnt found what i wanted like nice cool noise free place.    finally i found out that chada thai house maintained by well co-ordinated staff like real your house feelings.    Generally its a good budget hotel for single /double holders.    breakfast is good complementary everyday.    likewise walking distance near the central pattaya road & the most oustadings beach in the world.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929814,100.882614&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929814,100.882614&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.931667,100.879440|12.930410,100.879868|12.931495,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.933609,100.881073|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774&signature=2l7JF5Dddwv1wJAR70388HHyMKg=",1.0,Positive
7,"CHAPLIN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","This was my first ever visit, just needed the one night and it wont be the last visit. I feel it necessary to put some old reviews to bed.  Agoda prices are different to walk in prices because Agoda offer an online service, Agoda also take a cut and Agoda also don't pay the establishment till later. Ergo if you want to use Agoda's price then use Agoda.  The area is safe as anywhere at night, A short walk (left as you walk out) and then right you are on the main road for Tuk com, beach road (with turning a for 2nd road and Soi Bukhao). Across the road is a 7/11 and several restaurants as well as a restaurant to the immediate right.  The reception staff were polite, limited English it sufficient enough to greet you with a welcoming smile and make a joke.  My room was booked through agoda and for the price I was very happy, big room, 2 balconies one with table and chairs. Bed was comfy, the room was clean as was reception.  The only flaws were in the bathroom but nothing too drastic. The hairdryer supplied didn't work, the toilet seat had actually come away from the toilet, the shower doors didn't close properly and the shower unit head itself was different to the shower unit on the wall meaning it could not be operated hands free.  For the price you can't knock it and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. near to jomtien near to walking street 10 min great location and room clean,all staff kind and helpfull..a quiet sleep if you choose rooms cross the street.everday room is clean and powerfull air con.no breakfast but you dont need it my mind.. coffee machine in room I stayed here for 2 nights and I did not had any issues... The staff were friendly... Welcomed with a big smile.. The room was fine with all the basic facilities... Since I have booked with booking.com there were no issues regarding the payments... They allowed my 1 hour to check out late even... Nice stay... I will definitely come back... Stayed for an overnight upon arrival to Pattaya. Room was clean, large and well equipped. The lady at the reception could hardly understand English. Breakfast was poor and there was cold omelets ... Location is far from the main center and some drivers needed time to locate the hotel... HUGELY UNPROFESSIONAL. Really bad experience from start to finish. Stayed 7 nights total - from the off the receptionist insisted we pay 800 baht for a 600 baht room, and only backed down when we were firm that we knew the price. They then asked us to pay for the nights we'd stayed a few days in, and again tried charging 800 a night despite it being confirmed we were paying 600. We had constant calls waking us up insisting we had to check out, when we'd been very clear on the date we were leaving.    The wifi stopped working pretty early - we had to book tickets to the next country and visas within this timeframe, and not ONCE were we given even a simple apology (this applied to every issue we had) or offered a solution. After 3 days with no wifi and on the last day we could sort our visas, we came up with our own solution; again staff were completely unbothered.    Upon checking out, willing to pay full price despite the lack of advertised services, we were told we had to pay 1000 baht for a small makeup stain on the sheet and shown a photo. We explained it easily washed out, but they insisted we must buy a new sheet. When we argued with this, they brought the sheet down, which had a pen stain - completely different to the photo and FULL of holes. Stain or no stain, it needed throwing out. During this whole ordeal a member of staff came down and SCREAMED at us, causing a shouting match, then shouted about us to the other member of staff in Thai while glaring at us. They even threatened to call the police. I've never experienced this level of unprofessionalism. Scammer central - would not recommend to my worst enemy. Air con and occasionally working wifi might be ok for a quick stay but there are so many better options around that we wish we took. On the plus side they ordered us a McDonald's Right from the offset, the woman in reception tried charging us 800 baht a night even though we'd seen a fixed price on booking.com for 600 a night. The rooms were ok, but 600 a night is still very steep for the 'service' we received. We didn't have wifi for 3 of our nights, despite explaining to the reception staff that we needed the internet to book visas and flights etc. We received no apology, no explanation and no attempt to come up with a resolution. We had to ask ourselves if we could be moved to a floor that had wifi. Upon checking out, they tried to charge us 1000 baht for a 'stain' on the bed sheet that was not us, and when we contested it they threatened calling the police. We refused to pay for the stain, and then one of the housekeeping ladies came down and was especially rude. Still, after everything, no apology and no explanation. We left feeling like worthless customers and disappointed that we'd spent so much money there. Also the hotel offers no food or drink and despite being nearby restaurants and shops we felt unsafe walking around at night. Do not stay here!!!! first lobby so hot no air conditioning  and dirty floors,some staf frindly  room cleaning service 3 person then is good  bed so soft I can say great ,  if room not looking main way silent  air conditioning working good  to walking street by walk 8 min  but here expencive Wifi is important for me...in my room, it was nonexistent. So were any traces of food or coffee, and it was a bit of a walk to get some. A problem, since, especially at night, I did not feel safe walking in the area. My shower was a treat! The only hot water came from the middle, hand-held spigot...there was an overhead ""rain"" shower head, but it only provided cold water, as did the lower sink-type faucet. Not a problem, really, but the hand-held faucet could only be hand held...there was no bracket to attach it to. The shower floor was installed slanted, so the drain did not work...all the water leaked out onto the bathroom floor, which meant I couldn't brush my teeth, etc. on a dry floor. I did mention this to staff, who said they would help, but they did not. My room was not cleaned every day, although they did leave water and tissue outside the door. Overall, it's just not a well-thought-out property. For the price, you can get much better in Pattaya. I stayed here for two nights and was very pleased. Staff very helpful and efficient. Most comfortable beds ever also rooms very clean. For the price it's about as good as your gunna get here in Pattaya. The last room I stayed for the same price was an absolute dive. If for you the most basic in an hotel is cleanness and good wifi then this place is not for you. When I checked in my room the room was clearly not done (hair everywhere; toilet dirty...So I kindly ask if it could be well done. When I came back into the room nothing has much changed. Furthermore the towels had bad smell and the bedsheet do not seem to be very clean either. I could hardly used wifi during my stay. Only positive points are that the place is located in calm street. I visited this hotel last week, I was looking for a budget hotel for less than one night stay , accidently found Chaplin, I step in, got a room in 3rd floor, there was no elevator, but when I got into room I found it very clean, all facilities in there, mattress did not expect will be in small hotel, seem owners take care small important details, finally I extend 4 nights, its newly open, I rated 5 Stars coz what I paid,, to what I got , I consider it more than great value.  Keep on and good luck Stayed here for one night.we were supposed to stay a week but after looking a little closer at details the shower tray was badly cracked, which would harbour germs and it hadn't had a thorough clean since it was last occupied as long black hairs on the floor which couldn't belong to me or my husband and dead ants in places when we piled out furniture.  Otherwise a nice hotel but I'm sorry this let it down .  As we got another hotel in a better location for the same price we decided to move the following day. One of the best room in pattaya Hotel is very clean and the mattress is very comfortable,staff is really very very helpful and the room is really big , around 800 meter from the walking street and the beach road the only problem is no elevator and parking Staff is friendly enough but owner is very rude. No services mind at all. He is not suit hospitality business at all. Hotel is new, clean and spacious enough. I would give 5 bubble reviews if owner behave well. This was my first ever visit, just needed the one night and it wont be the last visit. I feel it necessary to put some old reviews to bed.  Agoda prices are different to walk in prices because Agoda offer an online service, Agoda also take a cut and Agoda also don't pay the establishment till later. Ergo if you want to use Agoda's price then use Agoda.  The area is safe as anywhere at night, A short walk (left as you walk out) and then right you are on the main road for Tuk com, beach road (with turning a for 2nd road and Soi Bukhao). Across the road is a 7/11 and several restaurants as well as a restaurant to the immediate right.  The reception staff were polite, limited English it sufficient enough to greet you with a welcoming smile and make a joke.  My room was booked through agoda and for the price I was very happy, big room, 2 balconies one with table and chairs. Bed was comfy, the room was clean as was reception.  The only flaws were in the bathroom but nothing too drastic. The hairdryer supplied didn't work, the toilet seat had actually come away from the toilet, the shower doors didn't close properly and the shower unit head itself was different to the shower unit on the wall meaning it could not be operated hands free.  For the price you can't knock it and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. near to jomtien near to walking street 10 min great location and room clean,all staff kind and helpfull..a quiet sleep if you choose rooms cross the street.everday room is clean and powerfull air con.no breakfast but you dont need it my mind.. coffee machine in room I stayed here for 2 nights and I did not had any issues... The staff were friendly... Welcomed with a big smile.. The room was fine with all the basic facilities... Since I have booked with booking.com there were no issues regarding the payments... They allowed my 1 hour to check out late even... Nice stay... I will definitely come back... Stayed for an overnight upon arrival to Pattaya. Room was clean, large and well equipped. The lady at the reception could hardly understand English. Breakfast was poor and there was cold omelets ... Location is far from the main center and some drivers needed time to locate the hotel... HUGELY UNPROFESSIONAL. Really bad experience from start to finish. Stayed 7 nights total - from the off the receptionist insisted we pay 800 baht for a 600 baht room, and only backed down when we were firm that we knew the price. They then asked us to pay for the nights we'd stayed a few days in, and again tried charging 800 a night despite it being confirmed we were paying 600. We had constant calls waking us up insisting we had to check out, when we'd been very clear on the date we were leaving.    The wifi stopped working pretty early - we had to book tickets to the next country and visas within this timeframe, and not ONCE were we given even a simple apology (this applied to every issue we had) or offered a solution. After 3 days with no wifi and on the last day we could sort our visas, we came up with our own solution; again staff were completely unbothered.    Upon checking out, willing to pay full price despite the lack of advertised services, we were told we had to pay 1000 baht for a small makeup stain on the sheet and shown a photo. We explained it easily washed out, but they insisted we must buy a new sheet. When we argued with this, they brought the sheet down, which had a pen stain - completely different to the photo and FULL of holes. Stain or no stain, it needed throwing out. During this whole ordeal a member of staff came down and SCREAMED at us, causing a shouting match, then shouted about us to the other member of staff in Thai while glaring at us. They even threatened to call the police. I've never experienced this level of unprofessionalism. Scammer central - would not recommend to my worst enemy. Air con and occasionally working wifi might be ok for a quick stay but there are so many better options around that we wish we took. On the plus side they ordered us a McDonald's Right from the offset, the woman in reception tried charging us 800 baht a night even though we'd seen a fixed price on booking.com for 600 a night. The rooms were ok, but 600 a night is still very steep for the 'service' we received. We didn't have wifi for 3 of our nights, despite explaining to the reception staff that we needed the internet to book visas and flights etc. We received no apology, no explanation and no attempt to come up with a resolution. We had to ask ourselves if we could be moved to a floor that had wifi. Upon checking out, they tried to charge us 1000 baht for a 'stain' on the bed sheet that was not us, and when we contested it they threatened calling the police. We refused to pay for the stain, and then one of the housekeeping ladies came down and was especially rude. Still, after everything, no apology and no explanation. We left feeling like worthless customers and disappointed that we'd spent so much money there. Also the hotel offers no food or drink and despite being nearby restaurants and shops we felt unsafe walking around at night. Do not stay here!!!! first lobby so hot no air conditioning  and dirty floors,some staf frindly  room cleaning service 3 person then is good  bed so soft I can say great ,  if room not looking main way silent  air conditioning working good  to walking street by walk 8 min  but here expencive Wifi is important for me...in my room, it was nonexistent. So were any traces of food or coffee, and it was a bit of a walk to get some. A problem, since, especially at night, I did not feel safe walking in the area. My shower was a treat! The only hot water came from the middle, hand-held spigot...there was an overhead ""rain"" shower head, but it only provided cold water, as did the lower sink-type faucet. Not a problem, really, but the hand-held faucet could only be hand held...there was no bracket to attach it to. The shower floor was installed slanted, so the drain did not work...all the water leaked out onto the bathroom floor, which meant I couldn't brush my teeth, etc. on a dry floor. I did mention this to staff, who said they would help, but they did not. My room was not cleaned every day, although they did leave water and tissue outside the door. Overall, it's just not a well-thought-out property. For the price, you can get much better in Pattaya. I stayed here for two nights and was very pleased. Staff very helpful and efficient. Most comfortable beds ever also rooms very clean. For the price it's about as good as your gunna get here in Pattaya. The last room I stayed for the same price was an absolute dive. If for you the most basic in an hotel is cleanness and good wifi then this place is not for you. When I checked in my room the room was clearly not done (hair everywhere; toilet dirty...So I kindly ask if it could be well done. When I came back into the room nothing has much changed. Furthermore the towels had bad smell and the bedsheet do not seem to be very clean either. I could hardly used wifi during my stay. Only positive points are that the place is located in calm street. I visited this hotel last week, I was looking for a budget hotel for less than one night stay , accidently found Chaplin, I step in, got a room in 3rd floor, there was no elevator, but when I got into room I found it very clean, all facilities in there, mattress did not expect will be in small hotel, seem owners take care small important details, finally I extend 4 nights, its newly open, I rated 5 Stars coz what I paid,, to what I got , I consider it more than great value.  Keep on and good luck Stayed here for one night.we were supposed to stay a week but after looking a little closer at details the shower tray was badly cracked, which would harbour germs and it hadn't had a thorough clean since it was last occupied as long black hairs on the floor which couldn't belong to me or my husband and dead ants in places when we piled out furniture.  Otherwise a nice hotel but I'm sorry this let it down .  As we got another hotel in a better location for the same price we decided to move the following day. One of the best room in pattaya Hotel is very clean and the mattress is very comfortable,staff is really very very helpful and the room is really big , around 800 meter from the walking street and the beach road the only problem is no elevator and parking Staff is friendly enough but owner is very rude. No services mind at all. He is not suit hospitality business at all. Hotel is new, clean and spacious enough. I would give 5 bubble reviews if owner behave well.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.924583,100.883057&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.924583,100.883057&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.927390,100.883560|12.925632,100.883415|12.924911,100.885117|12.924070,100.880814|12.924639,100.879662|12.925678,100.881332|12.925760,100.885078|12.927651,100.883751|12.928725,100.881889&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.923672,100.882370|12.925162,100.883400|12.924907,100.883331|12.924564,100.880341|12.927831,100.883133|12.927550,100.883583|12.928528,100.883720|12.927030,100.886185|12.925317,100.880257&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.927748,100.883247|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294|12.925020,100.884567|12.928134,100.881966|12.926652,100.882309|12.928206,100.881882&signature=PoZU_UFNYeoSPkXxlif8X2UfQYk=",0.9997,Positive
8,D LIVING HOTEL PATTAYA @ JOMTIEN - Prices & Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"Its a good area to visit lots of things to do. The shopping is good priced. There is a big problem the temperature is very high from middle of march. I do prefer to go to Thailand november until february. If I could, I would give them 0 point.  I paid for one night but I stayed there only 15 minutes. Booked for garden view, got a ""wall view"" in a dark corner. No cctv, no privacy, no security guard, no parking. The receptionist can not deal with the problem. She is too young for the job and helpless. They let big thai group to have big party at the hotel pool and put loud music. Even I closed the room's door, I still heard that noisy music. Won't go back. we have our three nights stay in d living from july 8-11, the first night one of our room with no hot water. we tell the reception man the problem, and he said he knows the problem but still give us the room.  if he knows, he should tell us while check in, we don't mind to share bathroom instead my elder parent has cold shower that night, and no apology at all.  overall, it is under average. bed sheet with stains, please refer to picture, stained and old towels in bathrooms. as a hotel opened in 2015, it is surprised everything turn old so quickly. telephone in the room can call the reception only, no room to room function. breakfast is simple, toast taste the best. staffs not friendly and bad in english. the safe box is not working too. Clean hotel located close to one of the worst parts of the Jomtien beach. Ok rooms, nice pool and garden which occupies by tons of mosquitoes specially at nights. On the webb they offer twin beds which is a lie, they just putt 2 single beds side by side and smiles.  Average breakfast sanctions and serves by military precision with a thai smile. Another peace of bread costs 30 BT. Loudly music turns the breakfast to a horrible start but they turn it of around 9-10 pm, so quiet nights and good sleep.  Nobody talks english but a guy at the night shift.  WiFi? No way. We had it only 3/7 days with very low speed and unreliable. They don't offer ""guest computer"". This hotel I believe had been recently updated. We had a thoroughly modern and clean room.The beds were great. So comfortable. The shower very modern and had good water pressure and temperature.The swimming is set amid the cabins and is warm and clean. And I couldn't believe how innexpensive it was. We are definitely going back. Go judge for yourself. Great breakfast btw. We visited to Pattaya with a group of friends and stayed at D Living. The price is reasonable I guess. The rooms decoration is modernize and atmosphere like a youth. We really like the pictures of the rooms. The bed and other facilities are excellent and quite worthy for what you pay. But only one weakness which is there is no door for bath room and toilet. Such a weird room allocation I had ever seen. There is only a curtain for both separate restrooms. They should at least do the slide doors. I share a room with my male senior and we had a problem with that. One have to stay outside while one is using the restrooms. Such a terrible ... ! And one more thing... breakfast is less choice.... When we arrived hotel staff who check in bit slow üò° the room was dirty look like nobody stay in this room more than one month a lot of dust in room ;( shower room a lot of hair on the floor .. room so small and hot in day time we set 18¬∞ all the time...Breakfast no choice !! we not recommend for this place !! I am happy that I found this hotel as it covered all that I was looking for. The price was very reasonable. The place was modern with some funky decor and the location 3 mins walk from the beach at the quieter end of Jomtien beach. The pool was perfect for sunbathing and swimming (no umbrellas).    Due to the setup of this hotel the rooms are all very close together, so it all depends how courteous your neighbours are. Our first few days were bliss, then a group of 5 Chinese families came along.    One member of staff stands out as being really on the ball and helpful, ensuring that everywhere was being kept clean and directing the others (short hair friendly female). But other staff didn't seem to get the whole customer service thing, with bins overflowing, dead bugs at bottom of pool, messy communal areas.    3 choices for breakfast: fried rice, Khao Tom soup, American (drinks extra)    Rooms: comfy beds, soft sheets. Mini bar. Safe. Hairdryer. Be aware that toilet and shower are behind a curtained door and open onto the bedroom (not much privacy).    All in all a nice modern option in Jomtien. Had a wonderful 10 days staying here in Feb. Great location the beach can't be more then 100 metres away. The hotels interior is absolutely stunning modern yet noir, the staff are great and the pool is amazing. Not a very large hotel which is a bonus so staff are very attentive. All in all one of the best hotels I have stayed in full stop. Wow. This hotel really surprise me and my family, the hotel with very open and beautiful design.  The staff very polite with kind and friendly attitude.  I really like the building design with villa style.  My kid really happy with the pool view. This hotel near to the beachside with only 5 mins walking distance.  Breakfast with delicious taste but limited choice. (Remark: Kids also need to pay 99bath)  Overall we really happy with this hotel stay. And sure will stay again in this hotel when visit to Pattaya again. Spent 7 Nights here at D Living Hotel, Checked in to Smiling Happy Staff,Very Friendly,Room 19 Tucked away in a quiet corner ( As I Requested a Quiet room) so I Was Happy with that,Room Very Clean Good Bed,The ONLY Disappointing thing is that The Toilet & Shower room are only seperated by Plastic shower curtains when perhaps a Sliding door would have been MORE Private especially using ""The Throne "" ( WC ) But aside from that NO Complaints, Breakfast was O.K But served A La Carte, So only 3 CHOICES The Usual "" Eggs,Ham & Sausages ( Hot Dog Type ) with Toast, Or Fried Rice or Rice Porridge.....Coffee, Juice & Water....But Sufficient to see you through the day until evening....A Really NICE Touch on Valentines Day My Wife was presented with a Small box of Chocolates & The Staff put Heart Shaped Balloons in each room...We Would Definately Stay again at this "" Very Happy Hotel ) Very nice little Hotel, good prices nice rooms, pool area is just outside your door, breakfast was ok, friendly staff there English was not the best but ok.  Poolarea is really Good Clean and nice.  I can really recommend this Hotel. The theme of our Getaway to Jomtein beach is to avoid the hustle and bustle of the city. D Living is a great choice of hotel if you are looking to enjoy the calm and the peacefulness away from the city. In the center of the hotel there is a swimming pool. During the night time the lights are switch on which create romantic ambiance. The room was big and clean with comfortable bed. Eventho it is far from pattaya but the public pick up truck are available almost anytime and the fee is only THB 20. The beach at Jomtien beach is better then pattaya. Hoewever the hotel does not provide toiletries and the information of tourist attraction at the receptionist is not sufficient. Lastly, the hotel is one of the best place to be if you are planning for a retreat to the countryside In the month of May, my beautiful wife and I visited the Thailand, we decided to go to the Pattaya, my wife choose D Living Hotel for our 2 nights stay, that hotel was very nice, staff was friendly, beautiful swimming pool, comfy beds and interior was very good. We really enjoyed our stay. I recommend when ever you visit the Pattaya must stay in D Living Hotel. Its a good area to visit lots of things to do. The shopping is good priced.

9,"DRUNKEN DUCK GUESTHOUSE - Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","Well almost spent 16 days here having breakfast and coming back for a light lunch Great staff great and atmosphere would recommend to anyone 10/10 üòãowner and staff always have a great welcome and nice accommodation available at great rates!!    Please check it out really nice people!üáπüá≠üôèüèªüáπüá≠ Only stopped by for a quick drink. Good place to sit and people watch. Good service from the staff. Great location. Plenty of seating but it can get busy in the evening because of where it is. Pool table and TV's showing sporting events. Went their most days during our 6 day binge to kick the day off. Freindly venue in a great location on Soi LK Metro and good priced , cold beers..The venue definately fires up as the sun goes down and the street transforms into a mass of neon colored signs lighting the way. The front verandah location is the go to get closer to the action with live sports on all channels.. i would recommend this place for an ale or two.. Went in the bar waiting for a friend.  About 5 young bar girls gathered out the front laughing and joking.  Yes you guessed it on the phones as well. I walked into the bar they didn't move or socialise.  Older woman served me and didn't smile or give eye contact, friend came so I drank up and we left.  Were going to stay have a few beers and pool.  But moved on to dragon bar instead phoned the rest of our friends and they met us in dragon bar instead?! I've had the English breakfast here a few times which is pretty good but there are other better options nearby. I've never stayed in the hotel so couldn't comment on the rooms but this is a decent bar to watch English football matches in and there's always a friendly crowd drinking in here. I can't speak for the guesthouse, but the bar is a good quality sports bar with a decent pool table and chairs to sit on and enjoy a beer.    Good relaxed atmosphere with a combination of tourist and local expats.    Food is good, especially the chicken wings (must try). Hi guys I checked into here by accident august 2015. They gave me a room. The room was ok.Glad i didnt stay there for the 2 weeks.. About 15 min later i realized i had checked into the wrong place my Hotel Was next door. The Service was great i got a refund. Its a cook 24 hour bar Sexy Ladies there too... I stopped in the Drunken Duck for one night on my first visit to Pattaya. I was given a room on the top floor (4th floor) it was very basic but what can anyone expect for ¬£11 a night. It was very clean though and had air con, safety deposit box and cable tv. The staff I encountered were very friendly and happy to help anytime. This guest house is located on soi lk metro which is a Ive just eaten a breakfast here, Real bacon, Sausage, Baked beans etc including Tea/Coffee and Toast, all for 99 Baht, Excellent! Clean, Friendly staff and good food. Ide recommend the food, i cannot comment on the accomodation as never stayed. Great location for solo traveling men, if you catch my drift lol.. Nice bar, pool table, cheap drinks, good food service, and right in the middle of a ton of bars and restaurants. The best part of the duck is their staff, super helpful, friendly, and very accommodating. Just ask for sassi the manager or nicholas and they will take care of whatever you need. Can't wait to return. My first trip to Thailand was an amazing experience largely because of the Drunken Duck. The rooms were nice enough. Good shower, clean room and cable TV and wifi. What makes the Drunken Duck special for me are the people that worked there. They bent over backwards to make sure I was conformable and all my needs were met. The ladies that work there are very friendly and some can give you a dang good game of pool. Haha! you know whom I'm talking about. It starts with good management with Sassy who has the respect of her co-workers and that's because she respects them. I will miss my friend Peam the most as she is the sweetest girl I met in Thailand.I am already planning my next visit to Pattaya and can't wait to see my friends at the Duck. I love this place! I stayed in this guesthouse for few days and I had great time! Place is well located in Pattaya (especially for people that wanna have fun!) and has been recently renovated. The room was very clean and comfortable and the staff always very friendly and kind. The manager was great and she even arranged my transportation to the airport.  Very good breakfast and very good value of money also compared to other locations near there. I will be back soon! Stayed here 1 night and I was gone. The beds are hard as a rock, the shower has little pressure, the AC was like a fan and it is on a noisy Soi    Not worth the time, effort or savings for this hotel    The owners must not care as the place is very dirty I stayed at the Duck for a week as my other hotel had let me down in terms of being double booked. I was familiar with the Soi LK area and its emerging nightlife.  I called into the Duck one evening and asked for a weeks accommodation from the following day. The staff on the bar are very helpful and cheerful and showed me the available room and took a deposit which was returned at the end of my stay.  I was allocated Room 3 at the rear which whilst quiet is a very small room with ill fitting curtains and a bed which must date back to 1970. The springs were very uncomfortable and I realised rapidly that a seven night stay would be seven nights too long. However, I decided to give it a go and try one night in Room 3 which was not pleasant.  The following day I requested a room change and the only available room was Room 1, a much bigger room overlooking Soi LK. This was much better and he room was considerably bigger but I did notice that the window was very ill-fitting and someone could easily have entered the room byclimbing onto the balcony and sliding open the window.The bed, whilst not as bad as Room 3, also needs replacing. However, the room was kept clean, it had good AC and a tiled floor with in-room safe and a fridge. I was concerned about the noise but I was surprised that whilst the hotel is on Soi LK it was not as noisy as I expected and had no problem sleeping. However, one night, I got no sleep as there was an all night party in a 'golf' bar opposite, presumably Americans watching the overnight superbowl. It was incredibly noisy until 7am which there is little the management for this guesthouse can be held accountable for.  My room in the bigger room was 1000 a night which I think is probably the maximum they could charge. Room 3, the smaller room whould be refurbished as it is not worth more than 500 baht in my view.  The bar and hotel is clean, cheery and friendly with helpful staff. Deposits are returned and a problem I had one evening relating to an electric problem was dealt with speedily. I think a weeks stay here is probably enough. The manager/owner appears visible which is reassuring. We visited Pattaya because we just had to see if it was what people had said it was, it was be prepared for what you will see. However that's besides the point we stayed with tony 3 nights, we got chatting to him one night and he was kind enough to fill us in on all the things to do and not do in Pattaya and Thailand in General he then asked if we wanted to go for a drink and took us round town for a bit. The rooms were great tv and air con couldn't fault this place. What can I say except that this has to be one of the best guesthouses in Pattaya. Tony is a top man and service here cannot be faulted, Tony didn't even get cross when I called him at 2.00am to find out how the TV system worked so that I could watch the UK football, he just talked me through changing the channel, service and room cleaning/changing bedding and towels top rate, I will be back.  All staff were friendly. happy and helpful, great place to stay.  If you get to know Jet (7) she's a diamond too. I booked this room via Agoda for a stay of 2 nights 31/12/12 I contacted the hotel via there web site to say I would be arriving late 9.30 pm and for them to confirm I had a deluxe room on the first floor, I did not get a reply which was worrying I was right to, I arrived at 9.30 wanting to dump my bags quick S&S and out to meet friends no chance, met by English guy to say sorry no rooms, but I have got you one round the corner what a great bloke (Tony?),anyway the room was terrible insects, smelly, old clothes in wardrobe? 5 flights of stairs stains on the walls worst room in Pattaya, and I have stayed in a few, no one to complain to only girls in bar with no English, back to the duck, Tony no where to be seen,ok one night ant going to be that bad so I struggled up the 5 flights of stairs with me 30k suit case, having just had a hernia op 10 days before, next day back to duck Tony no where to be seen later that day no, that evening no, so a second night in the room got back to it at 1am, a party in the street till god knows when, the noise was unbelievable. I met the owner of the so called hotel while he was fighting with his wife, I called my friend and he collected me at 5am to go and stay at his house, never did see Tony? Agoda refunded me a night‚Äôs money which is good customer service with an apology. I recommend Agoda but not the duck. rooms good as it was my first time in Pattaya Tony was very helpfull,good bar to watch the street life,just generally looked after well and felt safe thanks  ps good food  Went on a pub/bar crawl which was good fun and well organised Walked in off the street after being let down somewhere else locally and was made welcome immediately. We would have slept anywhere the first night after a long journey by road/ferry from Koh Chang but were pleasantly suprised at how spacious the room was, and the minimum of fuss at checking in. The room was cleaned every day and fresh towels were supplied. The (optional) breakfast was enjoyable, though there are also plenty of alternatives within walking distance. Not the type of place to take children for a family holiday but ideal for couples or solo travellers. Within walking distance of all amenities including the beach. All in all a pleasant experience and would certainly return at a later date. i stayed at the duck several times, in various rooms, to the front or the back, never found it overly noisy. also the cleanig took place every day inluding change of towels n making up the bed. dont know what other customers had issue wise, but mainly you get what you deserve n if you are arrogant or rude you cannot expect the staff to kiss your feet. i always had great fun with the staff, day or night time and the two lads running the show there, tony from britain n bobby from canada became good friends just as well. very helpful gentlemen.  since a while they added a restaurant making basic english/western meals and a few thai dishes plus snacks, did not get disappointed once. pricing is fair for all things and if you behave and drink well the lads sure send one round to you. My rating might be higher next time once i have actually stayed in the bar as a guest and not just as a punter    Dae Ed(previous reviewer)    I am not 100% sure of your claims about the room - what i do know is that a large part of the reason for your review is your ''anger'' at not being ''nannied'' by Tony!!!  You spent a while one night whinging to me that you chose this bar because of reviews on here and were very miffed that Tony was not there to molly coddle you  If you were desperate for information Tony was ALWAYS available to call and the staff could speak English and help you in any way necessary.  I suggest your review is mainly garbage but will find out pretty soon as i will stay at the bar as a guest next time instead of just using it as a leisure place  Best of luck on your next holiday - and brush up your pool!!  Martin I stayed at this guesthouse for 16 days in Nov/Dec 2012. I knew going in that it would be noisy at night but was surprised at just how much noise and for how long. I was never able to sleep before 3:30 a.m.  The problem for me is that in the 16 nights I stayed there, my sheets were only changed once, and the bed was only made approximately 4 times. Several days I went without garbage being emptied (although it wasn't full). 14 of the 16 days, staff were in my room, yet they only left water and towels most days. There was a large cobweb in the bathroom that was never cleaned.  This is the first of many reviews I have done on Agoda and Trip Advisor that I have stated that I would not stay at a hotel again. I would not stay here again.  The staff were friendly and fun, but the rooms were not cleaned and dirty. when i arrived they didnot have my booking which was ok stayed two nights was enough shower no good/ no cable tv/ bed was hard/ service none air condition noisy not quite what was aovertised better places around I enjoyed my stay at the Duck and would recommend it to any solo or couple. Great location and people working there are very friendly. The included breakfast was much better than I expected. Rooms were very clean, bed comfortable and the room was relatively quiet. The owner, Tony, is a good guy and enjoyable to talk to. He wants to make his clients happy. He was very gracious in helping to resolve a billing error on my stay. This was a great choice. The location is on a street full of go go bars (what rhey call a strip club) but the street was nice, clean and not the disgusting feeling these areas have in other cities. We are a maried couple and we tried every go go club on the street. Our favorite was Queen just around the corner :)  The rooms were very nice and clean. We ordered a superior room but it was on the 4th floor with no elevator so we asked to move to a regular room on 2nd floor. Was perfect, no need for a bigger room. Good a/c and hot water.  The matress wasn't the best I've slept on and there is a little bit of noise from the clubs (very little) as expected in a location like this.  We met the owner Tonny briefly and he showed us the area on the map and gave us recomondations. He also offered us drinks on the house. He lives in Pattaya for 8 years and knows the place well. Very nice guy.  It's not walking distance from Pattaya walking street but we went there 1 night and honestly this street is better imo...  Enjoy :) Stayed for 2 weeks in the superior room offering. Big bed, clean, air conditioned, adequate bathroom and balcony. Day and night staff very friendly and the boss Tony is a top man, more than happy to offer advice and knowledge of the area. The surrounding area is an up and coming area of Pattaya, you dont need to take many steps once outside the door for restaurants, bars and entertainment. It's a great part of town, and the Drunken Duck a great home base at a very reasonable price for what you are getting. Highly recommend and will stay again, very guest friendly. The Drunken Duck is a great place to stay in one of the best locations in Pattaya - Soi LK Metro. This was my third visit and I stayed in Room#1 - which overlooked Soi LK Metro. The room was nicely furnished in a modern style, with balcony, a/c, large fridge, ensuite, wall mounted safe, wall mounted LCD TV and DVD player. The bed was firm (which I prefer) and I slept soundly each night I was there. Noise from the street was not noticeable after 2am - if you prefer a quieter room they have some on the backside of the building. The ensuite is your standard combined guesthouse style toilet/shower with sink.    The Drunken Duck is owned/managed by Tony - an outgoing and courteous gent from England - who's always willing to head out with you into the city for a drink and will show you the best places in town. Then there's Bobby, who organises pub crawls to other towns in the vicinity of Pattaya and loves to have a drink. The staff at the Drunken Duck (Ann - supervisor; Lee - night cashier; Nid - day cashier and the cleaning ladies) are friendly, cheerful and helpful. The cleaning ladies do a top job on the rooms everyday and can be trusted with your belongings in your room.    The Drunken Duck does not currently have an operational kitchen/restaurant - though I heard some plans are in the works to get one running in the future. However, there is a selection of menu's from local restaurants in the bar and you can place your food order with the cashier/bartender and it will be delivered to The Drunken Duck quickly. I highly recommend breakfast from the Golf Club (located across the Soi).    I like returning to stay at The Drunken Duck as I am welcomed back as family and treated as such during my stay. I cannot recommend this place enough! Stayed at the ""Duck"" 3 times now and have thoroughly enjoyed my stay each time. Nice clean rooms, pleasant staff, fast internet and most important a great front man, Tony. A really good location with entertainment and nice restaurants at your doorstep. All the big live sports are shown and you may even get a toasted sandwich foc while you watch. All in all you will struggle to find better value in all of Pattaya. Just had my second stay of 2011 at the Drunken Duck and can't say enough about the place, staff or owner, best guesthouse in the town.    Big rooms, reasonable rates, helpful staff, perfect location with some of the best places to eat and drink in Pattaya on your door step, many of which deliver to the Drunken Duck.  The owner will go out of his way with recommendations and advice for visitors and he even arranges bar crawl trips.    Top tip is that Drunken Duck stocks electolyte powers and serves then to any hangover victims, couple of those work wonders if you like a heavy night!    If you want a guesthouse in Pattaya this should be your first choice! Drunken Duck is about as good as it gets. Right location, great rooms and happy staff. Owners go out of their way to make sure you have a good holiday. Can't say anymore just go there. My first time in pattaya, and stayed at three different hotels, and the drunken duck was the best by far clean/great girls/good friendly staff cant do too much for you. The owner Tony is a top bloke too. You wont go wrong if you stay here i promise, 'have a great time and don't fall in love!'","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.929804,100.885445&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.929804,100.885445&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930492,100.889503&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391|12.928204,100.885674&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589|12.929615,100.883430&signature=QC8GdgP4cDho6rAuzJLIdRnuO4Q=",1.0,Positive
10,"DUAN NAM ING HOTEL - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","The hotel has closed down. In fact tbey were removing goods while the last customers were still there last week. Impossible to know why or get a true answer. It was getting rather dates but was quiet with a lovely pool area not crowded by children. Staff were lovely and hotel was well situated. My friend and I moved to this hotel for 9 nights because the hotel down the road would not reduce their price for a week or more stay. The hotel published photos on the internet are definitely old. In reality everything is very worn or run down, including the pool area. THE POOL WAS CLEAN.    Having said that, I WOULD STAY AGAIN!    The rooms are very spacious, equipped with basic toiletries and water. No kettle, but there is a cold and hot water dispenser downstairs near the reception desk. Nook (‡∏ô‡∏∏‡∏Å) on reception, was invaluable. She helped us immensely! If it wasn‚Äôt for her, my rating would be lower.    Cons: No lift, but we were only on the second floor. Rooms needed deep cleaning and dusting. I‚Äôm guessing management doesn‚Äôt pay their staff enough for a thorough job. Management/owner needs to SPEND A LITTLE MONEY on furniture restoration. If you are a light sleeper, pay extra for a Pool side room OR take ear plugs.    Pros: Great location. Nice pool. Big rooms. Nook (‡∏ô‡∏∏‡∏Å). Large fridge. Comfy bed. Good internet, sat TV, air con and hot water. Perfect location on Soi Buakhao as it is close to many eateries, bars etc. Although the hotel is a bit tired it is spotlessly clean and the staff from front desk to the cleaners are very friendly and helpful. The swimming pool is always clean and has plenty of sunbeds and is usually very quiet. On a room tip I would always ask for a poolside room as we initially had a street side room but found it extremely noisy until the early hours. I‚Äôve only just checked out of this hotel after booking for two nights .    I‚Äôve never stayed here before but due to the culmination of Buddha day and the Kings birthday most local hotels were full.    This is an outdated hotel that has certainly seen better days . The price charged by agoda was well over the day rate you can get as a walk in customer .    The rooms are as basic as they come , bed , fridge , tv, walk-in shower and toilet .    No lift so be aware of carrying heavy bags    The pool is dangerous.    The steps Into the deep end are broken and sharp metal is exposed  The steps Into the shallow end are slowing crumbling away and exposing the edges of sharp mosaic blue tiles .    The pool towels are also full of holes .    Two ladies on reception were particularly friendly and helpful and were the highlight of the stay. Soi bukhoaw is the area I always look to stay when I come to pattaya as it's near everything I need . in saying that hotels are plenty and many to choose from. This hotel price wise was great the pool area was quiet and the pool it's self was a nice size the staff I found was helpful and I enjoyed having some nice conversions with one lady staff member . the room although aged was good enough had a nice balcony which I enjoyed chilling out in the bed was comfortable shower done its job the room I stayed in had no safety box they do have boxes at reception the hours are ltd to when u can access them location of this hotel is spot on for me ..ideal .. the hotel is guest friendly as most are only down side is no lift to higher floors however worth asking for a lower floor room then the stairs is not an issue thumbs up from Me for this hotel I will look to stay again Although my expectations weren't high the way I was treated by the reception staff makes me wonder how they ever get customers ?? Rude obnoxious arrogance and bullying to say the least but heard the hotel is clean, obviously not done by them ??? If you read some of the other reviews it's happened before and nothing ruins a place or an experience more than poor staff, this place tops the bill for extremely bad staff  Avoid at all costs Old but very clean place . Except one lady all staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel has no elevator. For older people l would recommend the first floor only. You can bring also ladies in to Your room as l heard from other tourists I have stayed at this hotel many times over the years. It is a very cheap area filled with good little restaurants and with access to all the sites. The staff will remember you and make sure that you are in the room that you want. A very nice and clean pool is a refreshing experience after a day of walking around.    The hotel rooms are comfortable and clean. They could use a bit of updating as they have not changed over the years. I will continue to stay here in the future. Visited my friend who stays here every time he visits Thailand (anthony). Hotel rooms are basic but everything you need. The hotel staff are very very friendly which is a big big bonus to this hotel the reception staff are a credit to the hotel. Very genuine caring people :) Stayed here again now a 2nd time, only because all other hotels nearby booked out over the xmas/Nye period.  Rooms are ok, cleaned everyday , the standard rooms just have a small wet bathroom, the water from shower goes everywhere & the shower hose was short which made it even worse.  The ""delux"" rooms have an enclosed shower and a 4 poster bed with light curtains around it ( see Pics).  Wifi is near non existent , rarely worked I was on 2nd floor.  The pool was good , had a lot of shade in afternoons as surrounded by larger blds., couple of days they ran out of pool towels if u went to pool after lunch, just had to use room towels , didn't bother me too much.  Friendly reception & cleaning staff.  Oneday I got back to hotel and asked for key, I went upstairs & it wouldn't work, I was given the wrong key , to a room on a higher level at other end of bld. this wasn't good , if a dishonest person took it could of went through a other persons room.  Rooms have no safe , but they have security boxes behind reception which I felt safe & had no probs with.  Booking rooms with hotel via email wasn't easy as they don't always return emails, lot easier to book with Agoda.  Has no lift so try & get rooms on 2nd floor if u have heavy bags, & try get room at back of hotel overlooking pool as rooms at front get all noise from the bars, loud music ppl screaming till early hrs of the morning.  better hotels nearby for about same price. only stay again if others booked out. No sleep possible because some noisy men from iran were in the room above me, came back drunk in the night every day and made party together in one room with their ladies. Several complains with reception and the manager can not fix the problem. These muslim people didnt want to stop their disturbing behaviour. Normally the hotelmanager had to check out this people after they didnt want to change their behaviour disturbing other guests. But this people rented 4 rooms and the hotel maybe didnt want to loose money. But now they loose two long time customers, Me and my friend. They can put people like that inside, but they have to live with the decision of others who want a relaxing holiday. In other hotels these People had to check out after didnt want to change their behaviour. So, if you like noisy muslim men, then this is the right place for you. A great little hotel .Great value for money,well situated with friendly staff.It has a nice quiet pool area where you get the sun for most of the day.I have stayed there many times without any problems. I have stayed at this Hotel many times. It is cheap by comparison but it needs to be appreciated for what it is. Rooms can vary in condition, eg quality of the aircon, fridge, bed and shower. If you are spending a lot of time in your room then maybe check somewhere else. I find it quiet (poolside rooms) the staff are friendly and the pool is relaxing. I use it as a base to explore the region so only sleep and use it to refresh before I head out. It is close to all amenities and is out of the way of the hustle and bustle. Never had a problem with the security of my belongings in the room and the linen and room is cleaned daily. I have simple needs with basic expectations and this Hotel ticks the box. Stayed here for 5 nights, 850 a night . big rooms, had one over looking pool with small balcony. Friendly staff. good pool. clean hotel. , has no lift but stairs are easy to walk as not steep like some others. good location . lots bars restaurants nearby, Currently walk in rates are running from B700 per night. If you can get over the colour of the hotel it's a great place to stay. Stayed in multiple rooms here now and never had a problem or issues with any of the rooms. Poolside rooms are the quietest and lower floor rooms are the most expensive.  Booking system is a bit antiquated, ideal for walk ins though. Staff as friendly and helpful as ever. Good hotel, well located. Although not on beach front it has lots of shops and restaurants around it and is only 5 minutes walk to beach. It is very clean and old fashioned hotel with huge rooms including full size fridge. It fairly basic, no tea/ coffee making etc and no breakfast or food. Small restaurants around sell breakfast for $4 to $5. It is extremely cheap and great value for money. It has good pool area. Stopped here over Xmas and new year, loved it perfectly situated, lovely staff and spotlessly clean !! Stopped in higher star hotels but preferred this one by far it was right it was right in the heart of things but still lovely and quit at night, definately going back this year I stayed at this hotel over Xmas and new year on the recommendation of a friend, What a big mistake!!!!  The hotel looks like it was constructed in the sixties with its pink dull d√©cor, the whole hotel is in serious need of refurbishment, rooms are dark and dull with furniture to match, fridge was unhygienic with rusting grills inside, balcony was showing signs of decay and looked dangerous. ( see my photos). The air-con in our room just pumped out hot air all night, they could not adjust the temperature so we had to make do with a fan from reception!  We had booked a second room for family members for three nights over the new year, upon check in they told us their room wasn't available as it was double booked by an agent for the hotel and offered us an alternative hotel nearby. We refused their offer and booked the hotel next door for our family. The hotel had our contact number in Thailand for three months, strange how they couldn't find the time to call and inform us of the problem . VERY POOR MANAGEMENT. Looking at previous reviews on this hotel we are not the first to have this booking problem .  This is an overpriced budget hotel who's main clients are middle aged european men who come to Pattaya on a budget for the sex tourism.  The only plus point I found was the lovely staff who have to work in this dump, they where always polite with a typical Thai smile . A special mention to the Ladyboy receptionist, night shift receptionist and night shift security guard !    My room tip is to find one in a different hotel !!!!!!! Ok it's 1 of the older hotels on soi Buakhow and it's a bit cheesey looking from the outside but it's actually a well maintained property with large airy rooms equipped with A/C, old style tv, fridge and refurbished hot shower/wc. Balconey with chairs and table. King sized beds with decent linen.  The pool area is well maintained and gets plenty of sun during the day.  The pool side rooms are the quietest.  Oh and decent wifi. if you can't find anywhere else its OK .....for 1000 baht in January......just a bit too dear....its OK for a short stay ..till you can find a better place...the place is just getting a bit old...try to get in next door ..nature view hotel...its the same owner..newer building...1100 baht a night ..just ¬£2 more Stayed here in Nov 2013 for the 3rd time. Very disappointed this time around. After making a booking earlier in the year and clarifying by email many times, we arrived at around 11pm to only be told that they had NO rooms available until the following day. After explaining and showing them copies of the emails, they were not interested, but apologised for the inconvenience. We were then told that they would find us another Hotel for the night, which they did, at a more expensive price, but we had no choice. We also had to place a deposit to hold rooms for us for the next day. After all this run around, and to add more stress, it was now well after midnight and all the money changes were closed. Went back to this Hotel and asked (after much confusion from the receptionist) if we could change money from her. This request was denied, but finally talked her into giving us a small amount in exchange for $200 and we would replace that amount the next day. This is now after 1am. We are tired, hot, frustrated, stressed and very unhappy campers at this point. The next day, we sorted out our rooms and were finally settled. Two days later, I was speaking to 2 other guests at the Pool.........And to our amazement........this also happened to them!!!!!! I WILL not stay there again!!!!! It seems that the power (greed) of money is more important than looking after confirmed regular guests. I just wish that Hotel would see this review!!! Nice clean rooms, kept clean by friendly staff, clean towels every day, bed sheets changed regular, nice size swimming pool, televisions could do with an update as old and aged,reasonably priced, close to every thing a good base to see pattaya from we stayed here for 3 weeks in may 2013 great location nice pool friendly staff there is a travel agency next door if you want to explore the islands great market Tuesday and Friday just a 2 minuet walk away this hotel really ticks all the boxes you cant go wrong booking here . small hotel ,,with ssmall pool in quiet garden,a few chairs scattered around,,,,wifi works well and free ,,,unusuall for thia moneygrabbers,,good cable tv many stations,,prices are good for patts,,many good restaurants nearby and good back massage for 100 bht,,,and nickys bar for good enhglish breakfast Another enjoyable 2 week stay at this Motel. Staff are excellent especially the housemaids. Nice and quiet location if you stay on the pool side. Excellent pool. Around 800B or AUD $27 per night. Excellent Nightlife is just down the road. The Nightlife here is certainly cheaper and better than the expensive ""Walking Street"". I will add more photo's. I have stayed here on 3 occasions and will happily return.  The rooms are clean and spacious with a good size balcony. The staff are also very helpful and friendly. You can order some nice Thai or western food from their next door restaurant/cafe. I've stayed here 3 times now and have to say it's in a perfect location, 5 minute walk to 2nd road/beach. 7/11 just outside and plenty of bars. Peaceful enough for afternoon naps, staff are the friendliest most helpful you could wish for. Rooms are spacious,clean and have all the basics, only problem is no in-room safe. Swimming pool is great and never overcrowded, guest friendly hotel for the best price i've found in this area. stayed there now four times. Right in the middle of Pattaya and on Soi Buakaw where there are many bars and restaurants.Close to all amenities. Rooms are basic and standard but great value for money. Pool facing rooms are baht 50 more than road facing rooms. No lift but not a problem as there are only two flights of stairs to climb. However, the chambermaids will carry your luggage on their backs to your room. No bar area but beers are only baht 50 each. They have a small coffee shop/restaurant outside front entrance and will deliver food and drinks to your room or poolside.There is a money exchange outside front entrance offering best exchange rate in town. All rooms have ac and able tv with balcony, decent sized. No in-room safe but deposit boxes in reception. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Am returning there in a few weeks. Stayed here for 11 nights, and at 800B a night, found it very affordable and quiet, except for the construction around you, but that is happening everywhere in Pattaya. Air-con, TV, fridge, has a balcony and has 3 floors. Unfortunately there is no lift, but I didn't find that as a problem. There is no Restaurant, but one is in progress and should be finished soon. Eating is not a problem though as there are many Restaurants and Cafes everywhere. The staff are excellent and very friendly. A safety deposit box for you is downstairs at reception. The rooms do need a ceiling fan though, as the Air-con can get cold. Other than that, I found this place very good and plan to stay there on my next trip. Great location and only a few minutes walk to the massive nightlife. This was my third stay at Duan Nam Ing and as before it was nice and friendly. I had planned to stay at another hotel close by. But they messed up on my booking and I ended up in Pattaya in the middle of Songkran without a hotel. I called in at Duan Nam Ing on the off chance they had a room. And was lucky enough to get a room poolside for 800bht. Which is pretty good during Songkran.    The hotel itself is a typical no frills Pattaya hotel and is located on a busy soi in central Pattaya. Nice pool and all rooms have AC and cable TV. What makes this hotel stand out for me is the friendliness of the staff. The hotel is a family run business and this shows in the attitude and overall friendliness of all the staff. The two girls on reception were always polite and helpful and to me this is what makes this particular hotel stand out amongst its rivals close by.    The location of the hotel was perfect for me straight in the middle of the nightlife on Soi Buakhao. Its also on a busy songtel route. So you can get to walking street/beach road in about 5 mins for only 10baht. All in all the hotel was perfect for my requirements. What I like about this place is its great value for money.    The rooms are pretty good, though the bathroom could do with some sprucing up.    There's a TV, air-con, plenty of space, and either a balcony or sliding doors opening on to the swimming pool.    The pool is nice and just big enough to swim short lengths. The hotel has free wifi too.    The main downside is that it has no restaurant. There is a small bar which could make food and drinks but it never seems to be attended.    The location is acceptable if you know your way around Pattaya and are happy jumping on and off the 10 Baht buses. First of all this hotel is in Pattaya,not chonburi.  I've rated this hotel according to it's budget status.  Spacious clean rooms with good bed linen,a/c, minibar ,tv,good water pressure in the bathroom.Large balcony.Nice swimming pool.  The only negative is no lift.  Current walk in rate is B700.  Next door is the brand new Nature View hotel run by the same people who run J&P court.Had a look at the rooms here and they are quality for the discounted price of B800 although the pool is not yet up and running.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928950,100.884911&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928950,100.884911&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.924911,100.885117|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=yc-3H9VbsK3ZHNUC90c9lj1JChY=",1.0,Positive
11,"EAST SEA RESORT - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","a very nice pool just in front of the bungalow. The resort is every year comming down a bit more and it seems that necessary pending investments will not be done, that's a pity since the location is perfect and the resort offers a quiet environment close to the busy na klua rd.  There are certainly better places for lower price. I am very disappointed. The place is old and run down. The pillows in the bungalow smelled strongly of mould making the whole bungalow smell and even worse:    There are lots of broken tiles in the swimming pools, my daughter cut herself on one broken tile and came bleeding to me. I politely complained at the reception showing them my daughters cut hand and the blood but they did not care and the older lady there actually even turned her back and walked away from me and my daughter when I was not willing to accept her ignorance of what had happened    I found the behaviour unacceptable and requested to escalate to the owner (which I heard was a German) but the ‚ÄúThai Resort Management‚Äù I was allowed to talk to was certainly not management and no different. The attitude, although not the exact words I got was: If you don‚Äôt like it here go somewhere else, not accepting to refund the money I already had paid in advance    I requested to have the mould coloured smelly pillows replaced and was refused, I brought them to the reception to let the staff smell them and look at the discolouring and was refused again. I ended up buying new pillows at Big C that we used for the week I was there as I was refused refund and couldn‚Äôt really afford to pay for a second place too for my family    I have stayed at East Sea Resort once in the past, about 10 years ago, and I was surprised and disappointed with how the place obviously has not been maintained, how run down it is now, and the behaviour of the staff. Bungalows are 1200 baht and 1800 baht (end of 2015) and there are many places in Pattaya Na Klua that offer a much better experience for that price.    The resort restaurant prices are at the high end and service was slow. There is another place just down the road that offer buffet breakfast and better food for much lower prices, check it out    The nature around the swimming pools is nice and that is the only thing East Sea Resort has to offer really.    I strongly advice to look somewhere else Stayed here 1st time 20 years ago....  Still smiling staff ,very friendly,food inproved very much and bungalow room very clean and modern ....good quality bed , good shower , plenty of wardrobe space and good pool , will start to come back again.For 1200 baht I think very good value..... I stayed here due to be being close to my friend that owns a bar near by. For the price i can't complain..the pool was fantastic , the pool service was awesome. Defiantly saw lots of improvement. I will return ! Stayed in a worn down bungalow close to one of their pools, holes in a bridge, broken tiles all over area, this resort really really needs an update. Food/drink prizes high and they were understaffed (With Thai standards). All that being said the pools are nice if old an atleast our pool had a pool bar, another plus is the location easy to find not far off beach road and there are some bars and resturants close by.    Not worth the 1 800 bath we paid, there are many better places around in Pattaya for that price but not a total disaster for a night or two. Having used East Sea yearly on eight or nine other occasions as our golf tour base,this time around it was extremly disappointing.  We should have seen it coming as, we mentioned between ourselves that nothing in the way of upgrading or maintenance had been evident over the years we had stayed there. Most of the efforts seems to have been directed at the new East Sea Paradise 4 wing.  East Sea 1 is tired, run down and in desperate need of a real spruce up.  The outside bar area although functioning during the day has been stripped and now closes at 8.00pm. This was our meeting point after golf and before going out in the evening. Hugely missed there is simply nothing else on offer to guests.  At TB1300.00 per day without breakfast it is ridiculously overpriced. There are many better hotels nearby offering much better value and I suggest you look for an alternative.  Speaking of our golf tour group and we have spent a great deal of money over the years this will definitely be our last visit. Sad to say that looking at managements attitude it will make little difference. We were there for 3 days. Friendly staff. Good for the price. Rooms were good. Ours was an official trip to Pattaya. we were there for a conference. Any way it was nice to be there. Uploading these photoes, so that the staff too can see them, It would be very nice if so. Thanks. This Hotel has the worst service in Thailand. Stay away. Hard as rock beds , mosquitos, and the rudest service ever. These people must have taken a course in how to be cranky and rude.  There are much better places available than this. I was looking at hotels in north Pattaya, and this was the only one available. All 6-7 others were fully booked. The service was really poor, from the reception to the restaurant/bar. No one looked happy and the service personnel did not make me feel welcomed at all.    The rooms were budget which is understandable considering the relatively low price compared to other hotels around. There were many mosquitoes in the whole hotel but it does not look like it was a concern for the management.    All in all, would not have stayed there if I didn't needed to be close to that area. I have stayed here on a couple of occasions while on golf vacations.  Okay, its not 5 star but as a base if you are not over fussy about rhe fineries it is excellent value and in a good location in Norh Pattaya near Dolphin Circle.  Accomodation is chalet type with two ajoining apartments.    Bedrooms are O.K. and offer either double or two single beds. I found the mattresses hard but slept like a baby, so how bad can they be?  Adjoining toilet and shower area, has basic amenities and had adequate hot water for washing or showering. I visited a supermarket nearbye and stocked up on the usual shampoo and soap etc.  This is advisable as there is little on offer and it was not replenished daily.  The room had good air conditioning, mini bar and TV.    I did not eat in the restaurant, apart from a couple of breakfasts. From memory it was just O.K. but there are many eating establishments a short distance from the hotel to suit all tastes and pockets.  The swimming area is very nice and good for children and adults. Watch out for the suction outlets in the pool, they are extremely powerful and I brought this to managements attention as it could pose a real danger for children.    I found the staff all round to be exceptionally helpful and friendly, esecially Bo and her sister who look after the bar and coffee area.    Summing up a decent little place to stay, basic and not pretentious. Far enough away from the madness of downtown Pattaya it is very easy and cheap to get around.    Recommended if you are not expecting anything other than adequate accomodation. B1300 per day, clean rooms, 24 hour bar, no problem bring guest back to room booked part 3 got part 1 got now refound , Rooms are dirty , Bathroom is a disaster the Service is very poor ! Food tast like dogpo but you have to pay like it is Caviar  For the Price you can find much better Hotels or Resorts in Pattaya !!!  The Manager (Woman and Thai/Chinese mix ) is very unfriendly and as you can see the Resort is never fullbooked so it means she does a bad job .    stay away from the hotel or at least dont book the hotel over the own webpage ...take Thailandhotes etc . so you can change or canzel the Hotel if you not happy or get something you dont booked    Pools are all pretty nice ... thats the only pluspoint for his hotel from me My folks come out here every Christmas and New Year and I am starting to come out every other year to celebrate with them. The resort is broken up into parts I have stayed in part 3 and this year part 4.    Pt 3 from 2 yrs ago: This is very cheap accommodation and very conveniently located to get to the beach. The facilities are basic but exactly what you really want, rooms are nice and clean, you have a patio area to relax and then you have a communal pool to relax in aswell. This is a little dated, but I liked the small houses you stay in and the staff couldn't be nicer. I wouldn't call this luxury but it was exactly what was needed and no more.    Pt 4 this year, this is the brand new area, and it is really nice. The bathrooms have baths, you can tell they really tried to make this a nice place to stay and over all I think it is. The rooms are huge and I would even say perhaps much bigger than needed. They have a large sink in the room itself by the kettle, we were not sure why but I found it useful. The pool was very nice and I was relaxing there a lot. The manageress of pt 4 is to be highly commended, she is kind, thoughtful and has a great sense of humour. She is very much in control of everything at the resort and I don't think I have ever seen anyone work harder. I got flowers on my bed which smelt wonderful and I think that was just he maids being really nice to us. Breakfast was included in the room rate which it wasn't for pt 3, was basic but nice. (good bacon)    Over all pt 3 and pt 4, from a personal point of view, pt 4 is a lot more expensive than pt 3 and pt 3 had everything I wanted. I enjoy staying at the East Sea a lot, people are friendly, helpful and the rooms are really clean. It can be a bit noisy as there are a lot of Europeans coming here on holiday to enjoy the cheap night life (this is part of Pattaya not this area) Still didn't have any trouble with them and in gen they are all a good sport. Anyway I dare say the management can handle them! My partner and I wouldn't normally choose to come to Pattaya on holiday, he is T total and we are quite quiet people really. Oddly this place is really growing on me, people are friendly and a good laugh, food is good and a cold singha beer never hard to track down. If your looking for a place where you can have a break from 24hr partying then this is it, a small haven away from the madding crowd on your door step! a very nice pool just in front of the bungalow.

12,"EURASIA BOUTIQUE HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","We picked this hotel for proximity to a health centre I was visiting and it turned out to be an OK choice. I think this is more of a residence than a hotel as we seemed to be the only paying guests. The rooms were clean and spacious and the staff friendly.    Breakfast was included and as 'the only internet guests' a table was set just for us and breakfast was a basic, but adequate choice of eggs, sausage and toast with tea, coffee and juice.    If I was in the area for the same reason i would stay agin but its not the most convenient for restaurants, bars and the more lively parts of Pattaya. Rooms are not very clean: spyderwebs in the toilets. Wifi was terrible. Breakfast subpar. Stuff was quite unfriendly. Noise isolation is not existant, could not get a proper sleep. For this value expected much better. I found Pattaya to be pretty expensive but this hotel was good value cost about 1000 baht a night stayed for 3 nights during the water fight festival. the hotel was about a 10 min walk to walking street which was where most of the action was.    The room was very big with a big bed which was very comfy air con was a lil slow but worked fine.  the bathroom was decent wit a big walk in shower which had a lil mold in some places but wasn't bad at all,    I found the hotel grounds to be nice and staff was friendly,The pool was decent maybe could do with some more sun lounges.    The only disappointment i thought was the breakfast but considering the price i have no complaints about this hotel. this hotel is very good.very cheep and clan rooms.good pool.i enjoy in this hotel and pool.personnel are very kind.i stay 11day in this hotel.good for me.this hotel near the walking street.good breakfast.tanks Rooms okay, but pool very bad maintaned and very noise from other rooms and floors durty from garbes good value for the money. Pattaya has a lot of these types of hotels. If you come here at off season it's definitely a buyers market. This is a really nice standard hotel, the staff are lovely and helpfull. The problem is the location,although its only a 10/15 from walking street it is difficult to find, especially after a few beers, took me about 5 nights to nail the soi (its 16 or 17) that takes you from the walking street area to the hotel. Also there are very few bars near the hotel. The hotel is good value for money, but i will go back to a more central location next time i visit. it takes about 20min. getting near by the place to play. there`s a bike for 40BAT nearby the hotel so use them for go out playing. Hotel is good room but room amenity in agoda web write room have bath tub but no have, room rate quite expensive but room only should incl breakfast is better and quite far from main street. The eurasia is a rather new hotel so it is assumed that there is going to be a few kinks. however I enjoyed my stay very cheap, good service, but little out of the way i would deffinatley go back though. For food/dining i put a 3 because i didn't eat The hotel is nice and the staff is friendly. Now the horror story: I have my girlfriend get electrocuted in the shower. For some reason there was electricity in the water one night. She came out of it running like a bat out of hell. It was scary. We found out that in the room next door, the girl in the shower got shocked and felt unconscious. She ended at the hospital.    To our luck, it was our last day there. The staff gave us (and the couple next door) a free breakfast. WOW! you would have expected them to give us at least our stay free. The moral of the story, be careful of the electric water heaters wherever you go. Eurasia Residence Hotel  Date 25Sept-10Oct 2008  Reviewer A trip adviser member Brisbane Australia.  I have just returned from Thailand, Pattaya and after staying at the Eurasia Residence hotel i cannot heap upon it the praise it deserves.These residence were just excellent in every way,from the time i arrived to the time i left.  I Was impress with the service, and the staff could not do enough for me.The only short fall was the breakfast menu it did not change the whole time I stayed there. Other than that I would recommend it to every one who would like a quite and pleasant place to stay.  Regards R.A.Robertson This hotel is a must for all travellers in a peacefull setting staff are a1 the rooms are well appointed pool very good and only 5 minute walk to walking street. We picked this hotel for proximity to a health centre I was visiting and it turned out to be an OK choice. I think this is more of a residence than a hotel as we seemed to be the only paying guests. The rooms were clean and spacious and the staff friendly.    Breakfast was included and as 'the only internet guests' a table was set just for us and breakfast was a basic, but adequate choice of eggs, sausage and toast with tea, coffee and juice.    If I was in the area for the same reason i would stay agin but its not the most convenient for restaurants, bars and the more lively parts of Pattaya. Rooms are not very clean: spyderwebs in the toilets. Wifi was terrible. Breakfast subpar. Stuff was quite unfriendly. Noise isolation is not existant, could not get a proper sleep.

13,"EUROSTAR INTERNATIONAL HOTEL - Lodge Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights at a cost of 1000 baht per night. On the first day I reported a leaking toilet pipe in the bathroom, which was flooding the floor, the drain being uphill therefor the water could not run away. I reported it the second and third day. It was never fixed. The bathroom was the smallest one I have ever had in all of my traveling years.There was no curtain for the shower although the poles were there. Consequently more water all over the floor. After the first night I hung my card on the door requesting it be cleaned. I returned at 4 pm and it was not cleaned that day. The following morning my card was hung on the door once again. I returned at 4 pm still not cleaned. I reported it and they came to clean it at 6 pm. I had left the room while they cleaned it when I returned I was left one towel badly stained and my bed was not made up. The room had the lowest ceiling ever ( room 203 ) 6 ft 4 inches floor to ceiling. I am 6 ft so not a lot of clearance. The sheet on the bed had two big tears in it. The curtains were threadbare in places. I stayed at this hotel 11 years ago and it was tops. It has not been maintained and has a drab look to it. It should only be about 500 baht a night. Only thing good is position and Pool. No restaurant open while I was there. The receptionist was nice and friendly and was not her fault that management don't seem to care We arrived at this dump for a 4 night holiday. Booking a twin room and a double. The pool and position of this hotel is great , however everything else about this place is rotten through and through. Its dirty  With little to no housekeeping at all. Dads room wasnt cleaned two days running and ours on another day. The excuse they only have 1 cleaner for the whole hotel 30 bedrooms. Towels stained with holes, bedding ripped with big holes. The curtains thread bare , rooms totally unmaintained , leaking taps and toilets, dirt and mould and flys in bathroom. Really noisy and dirty fridge. Broken bed that meant changing rooms at midnight on first night. Aircon remote missing so on or off only . ( said guest took it ???) how long ago is unknown. Excuses for everything. Restaurant and bar not open at all. I could go on and on , but my advice is avoid this place like the plague. If i could give it minus stars it would be -10! Perfect taste, reasonable prices, friendly service. Jomtien Beach Road. We had some Thai dishes, were more than satisfied. The restaurant of the hotel is clean, and this is very important in Thailand ! I booked Euro Star International Hotel for 9 Nights after reading the reviews on Agoda ,10 ,9.2 good reviews. I paid 1100THb (49AUD) per Night.  At my arrival at this Hotel nobody showed me to my room or helped with the Luggage.  In the Elevator to the 5th Floor I nearly fainted, foul smell, hot and very slow Lift.  The Room looked cold, old and had no character, like shown on their Website, very old patches of paint everywhere, didn‚Äôt make me feel comfortable.  At night time I felt I was on a Airplane from the Noise from the air conditioner unit from the Big Hotel next to this Hotel  The Bathroom looked the same old and run down. I had No hot water, no floor mat and the Bath Towels, where dirty stained and ripped.  I checked out from this Dump after only 2 Nights ,losing 350 AUD ,but I couldn't Stay in a Hotel like this.  You can find better Hotels in the area for 500/600THB  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this Hotel to any Body, STAY AWAY from EURO STAR International Jomtien Beach Not happy we loved this restaurant four years ago, thinking it would be the same so decided to go back and take our friends.  Seriously bad service waited 45 minutes for our food and when it came out all together many of the dishes were cold.  Very poor customer service, the waitress was so rude when we complained and we would never go back.  At one point the waitress said to an elderly lady in the restaurant you are old and should know what a cappuccino is, my wife is Thai and couldn‚Äôt believe what she said.  I remembered this place as having good coffee this time is was ok but very weak and ordered another small cup to top up the Latte.  Prices high for what you get, certainly med to top end for small portions.  In all very dissatisfied Please don't confuse this hotel with the Eurostar which is next door the Eurostar is fine especially the restaurant ,the Eurostar international is awful. The bath was filthy, and the enamel was worn so it was impossible to sit in the bath without risking serious injury the shower curtain was covered in black mold. There was no hot water to the sink which leaked badly .The water in the shower was scalding hot and could not be regulated all these faults were reported at least 6 or 7 times but nothing was done.The bedroom was fine and the sheets were changed daily and the air conditioning worked but nothing could make up for the disgusting bath sink and shower. All the beds at the pool were broken .A bad experience A bit worn down hotel in a great location, a short walk down to the beach and the beach road, there you have a 7/11, a small market and varios (Pricey) farang resturants. There are some bars on the streets further up Jomtien Beach road not far away. During our stay they changed management, they seem to be renovating the rooms, changing beds and so on. My room was ok, bathroom wasnt the best but decent, well worth the price. The pool was good, nice place to stay if you are to lazy to go down the beach. The small bar was great, great staff, cold beer and a pool table, all you can ask for. The wi-fi worked very well , windows in the rooms open so you can smoke if you want. I wasn't sure before we went, if we had made the right decision but what a lovely experience. Delicious food and super friendly service. I really tried to find fault, really I did. Yes its a big place, yes it gets very busy but that didn't deter the staff in anyway. We had a great time and certainly will go back again. Had just the breakfast here. Standard American Breakfast. Eggs, bacon, toast, sausage. Tea coffe etc. Food was good. Staff friendly. Located on the beach rd straight across from the beach. Inside or outside dining. Didn't stay in the hotel. We booked two rooms in this hotel... When my friends opened their room.. The room was not ready yet.. So dirty everywhere so they went down to reception to complain again...  When i opened my room i smell something bad.. I went toilet and i saw waste in the trash can that was not yet thrown.... But i did not complain.. I just took out and changed with other plastic bags... No free tissue and water in our room... Toilet is dirty.. What i saw in internet is so different in real... Dont believe in photos... Staffs are not friendly... They dont entertain the costumers... Drab....dull... depressing.... thats how it looks today...... Right from the entrance of the Hotel which is the size of a regular room door.. to the dreary badly mantained lobby.... Only plus point were the Indian/Burmese staff that welcomes the guests in this forgetable property.. The beach is just 2-3 Minutes walk away.The rooms are average.But the staff is very friendly.The swimming pool is good and the food is good as well.There are lots and lots of restaurants around if you want to try Thai food and it is a must!The beach is a bit dirty,that is the downside of staying at Jomtien beach I have been staying at this hotel since it was built, mostly because of the excellent location and the fact that it has a small car park and I can usually park here.    The standards of cleanliness have dropped to an unacceptable standard, it's really filthy and grubby nowadays and I'm afraid that after many years of being a loyal customer here I will NOT return.    The bathrooms are disgusting, the air cons are not serviced and hardly work in the heat of the day and the staff do not treat the customers with any respect.    To make matters worse the car park that has approx 5 spaces has 2 spaces reserved for the owner and nobody else can park there, so my car had to stay parked on the street whilst 2 spaces were empty...    Do your self a favour and miss on this hotel unless standards improve. We booked through Hotels.com but manager said they did not receive confirmation. Hotels.com emailed them 2 more times and faxed them but they still said no. Had to pay twice the price and room is falling apart, towels are old and need replacing. Will not stay here again..

14,"GARDEN LODGE - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","The original Garden Lodge was a small hotel that offered a truly personal service. Sadly the hotel has been raised to the ground to be replaced with what looks like a massive hotel. The original hotel had less than 100 rooms whereas the new one looks as though it will have several hundred, so I wouldn't expect the service to be of the same standard. Like several other low rise resorts between Naklua Road and Wong Amart Garden Lodge has been sold off for demolition and redevelopment of the site as a larger hotel Unfortunately this will not come soon enough for the staff. Have had several happy stays there and sad to see it go. The hotel was pretty cheap. The rooms were really nice and clean. The hotel stuff is really friendly. Very calm atmosphere in such a busy city. The beach is 15min away by foot and you can reach the shopping malls really easy by taxi. Clean bedding & toweling every day. Very friendly and helpful staff. Very quiet location but only minutes away from local bars and night life. The beach of Pattaya is only 10-15 minutes walk awayIt has a poolside bar where food is available Stayed 12 nights in this hotel. Basic hotel no tea of coffee facilities in room. No safe in room. Electric shower also not much pressure. Staff on reception not friendly at all. Also bottled water not free in room. A nice pool but Germans have towels on sunbeds at 07:00hrs typical. I stayed here for three nights because, basically, my mate lives in North Pattya and his local pub is across the road (Jack Bar) and I visit him at least annually to get some beers in for my birthday. Hey! Any excuse is a good reason‚Ä¶  Aaanyway, It‚Äôs a quiet hotel on a busy street. Set back from the road via a short soi and circular driveway. There is off-street parking.  Entrance is an open reception area. Careful of the steps, it is quite gloomy area and the step is in an awkward spot. I tripped on it twice.  Checking in was a small nightmare as, for whatever reason, they absolutely *must* have your booking voucher in paper form to check in. Free welcome drink of juice.  I had to email them the voucher I had received so they could print it out. I would have thought the booking company would have sent them a reservation acknowledgement, too. Whatever.    Oh, to be warned and to make it easier for yourselves, too, be prepared the staff don‚Äôt speak English. I mean, there‚Äôs no reason why they should, how many hotels in, say, the UK have Thai-speaking reception staff? Exactly. And they have the same population.    Take your voucher, pass over you passport/s for photocopying, get shown your room. Relax.  My ‚ÄúPool View‚Äù room had nothing of the sort ‚Äì a view of some undergrowth and a disused rubbish bin is what I got.  The room itself was spacious, though, with a decent en-suite. There was an older style television, a mini-bar, two free bottles of water per day (as is normal throughout SE Asia) and a room-service menu.  Air conditioner didn‚Äôt work. Well, what I mean is while power went into the unit and one could adjust the thermostat, the refrigerant or compressor was faulty.  Not an issue for me as I basically live in Thailand now, without air conditioning, and wanted the thermostat set to 26 degrees anyway. Fan worked but the bed is about five metres from the unit so little benefit was gained.  Room was cleaned daily.  Didn‚Äôt eat there. Great Italian place on the street outside, to the left. Sensational. Bar across the road. Ten minutes‚Äô walk to the nightlife of Pattaya if that‚Äôs your thing. I‚Äôd get a motorcycle/taxi to the really pumping area of Soi 6 as it‚Äôs quite a hike from here.  This place is ideal for the quieter tourist or, like myself, an ex-pat not interested in the ‚Äúspecialist tourism attractions‚Äù for which Pattaya is renowned.    Three stars is a push. Two-and-a-half. But not bad considering the room rate of about $AUD32 a night.    Will return. With voucher. LOL For me now it's the 3rd time since March 2015 to be a loyal guest of the Garden Lodge. The initial core of this hotel is a bit aged but well equipped and maintained. Also just some years ago a new block with rooms was added.  All rooms are offering king size bed, AC, Int'l. Cable -TV, fridge, balcony and on request a catering service. The small but never overcrowded swimming-pool in the central garden invites for a rest and chill-out.  Most of the guests are middle-aged or elderly Germans, Austrians, Europeans.  So there's no trouble ahead with ""exotic"" behaviour a mayority of twens or some tourists from e.g. Russia, India or China might cause.  The location of this Hotel in Naklua road is quite perfect to have closeby many options for restaurants, beer bars, shops, money exchange, pharmacies, dentists a.s.o. To go downtown Baht taxis commute just in front of the door, and it takes only about 10 minutes to reach the mid of the Beach road or the Walking street.  For me the Garden Lodge is a ""budget oasis' and definetly more worth than just 2 stars! We loved the tropical feel of this place! The beautiful aroma of the plumeria tree outside our room was bliss!! The room was a reasonable size which had a nice little balcony overlooking the tropical garden and pool. The staff were so nice to us üôÇ even some of the guests staying there were friendly too!!    There is also 2 tiki hut bars to chill back and have a few cocktails at üå∫üçπ    The only downside is the wifi connection, it was hard to get connection. This is probably somewhere where no technology is used but rather A nice book to read on your balcony or near the pool which is just pure relaxation! Unfortunately they let the place run down.. The rooms are clean for Thai standards, but bathroom the smallest I've ever seen anywhere.. Don't expect too much, you get what you pay for here.. Staff is friendly. Pool is clean and probably the best part of the hotel. There are no pool towels, so better bring your own. Don't let your clothes washed here. The cleaning lady told me, she is washing them by hand, and drying them in the sun, so it may take up to a week because she needs to seperate colors... For that price, I expected machine wash and not an old lady having to clean my dirty clothes after work to make a couple bugs extra. The cleaning staff however is very trying and do a good job!! Should tip them well... The clientel here is, well... the typical Pattaya tourist. The first night, there was a fight in our apartment complex at 3 am, slamming doors, screaming, and breaking things. My 7 year old daughter was pretty scared. Overall, it's not worth more than 2 stars, and I wouldn't stay here again. Don't expect too much, this is a two stars cheap hotel. But the rooms are clean, the aircons working well, here is a restaurant, room and pool services, children pool. The location is perfect, right next door there is a Family Mart. I have been here third time and i can still reccommend this hotel for everyone who don't need luxus. The Garden Lodge Hotel in Pattaya is a decent hotel with pool in the medium quality range. Pool is clean enough, the pool bar is super lazy but on the other hand one can bring drinks from the neighbouring family mart I stayed here for many nights on several occasions. For the price, decent rooms. Nice reception staff. The cleaners have a bit of an attitude. Swimming pool good. Nice food at pool bar.  Possibly the biggest negative is the bar staff. A really lazy, couldn't care less attitude.  Also I don't really understand what hotel security is there for. Me and my rentagirlfriend were in my room at only about 9pm, just watching a movie and having some food when a German guy in the next room banged on my door and wall. I opened the door and before I could say anything he picked me up and threw me against the wall, cracking 3 ribs. He then locked himself in his room. I think he was envious because he had been leering at my rentagirlfriend in her bikini from his balcony, and his wife was a bit of a minger.  Hotel security did NOTHING.  The next day he checked out, because he knew my friends were coming to deal with him. Lol  Another time, there was an extremely drunk German at the pool bar who was abusing everybody, even telling an elderly lady ""F you"" for no reason. The staff did NOTHING.  Avoid this place! Good hotel in a great location, everything you need just outside.Lovely gardens and a decent swimming pool. Stayed 1 night on our way south. Bed was quite hard, but that's not unusual in Thailand is it? Wife and I stayed here November 2011 and for 1100 baht a night what more do you need? pool great room with balcony ground floor. Great value for the money no extraneous trimmings just very clean staff attentive and super friendly. The rooms surround the pool.and are quiet in daytime and nighttime. No banging music!! The restaurant was hardly used except for us, not cordon bleu, but good value and tasty Would definitely stay here again great location right on the main Naklua Road but set back slightly so no traffic noise. photos attached to this review for your info. a little extra gets you a bungalow, well worth it  keep an eye on the pool water quality, be forward in reminding reception if not up to scratch  good, basic bar snacks, thai food v.good very good location and the staff is o.k.  The swimming pool is clean and there is pool for childrens. The garden is nice. The rooms are clean and good for this price in Pattaya but it needs some reconditioning and the showers too. The restaurant is weak, better to eat elsewhere, there are many restaurant and buffet and marts near to the hotel.  I have been two times already here and i will come back here when i will be in Pattaya again. The original Garden Lodge was a small hotel that offered a truly personal service.

15,HILLSIDE RESORT PATTAYA - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Thailand) - Tripadvisor,"I had a pleasant stay with my family - the staff was very helpful and welcoming and at times went out of their way to assist inspite of not understanding English well..special thanks to our driver Ching who took us around wherever we needed to and Kum Preeda and K. Looks really nice on arrival - very handily located for the Pattaya Big Buddha.  Reception - guy behind the counter appeared to not know that he worked in a hotel - comical conversation where he didn't know anything about the check-in process or how to check we had a booking.  Eventually, after a chat with another staff member we ended up with the room we had booked. Be aware, there are NO LIFTS so if you have heavy cases, be prepared to get sweaty!  Very hard bed with a mattress that had seen better days - the springs creaked every time you moved. This is a shame as the room was spotless and the cleaner (she was just finishing as we arrived) had taken the time to spray the room for bugs and had obviosly cleaned the room to a high standard.  Another hotel that has a tired feeling where too little investment has been made in either facilities or staff well being - very disgruntled staff that appear frightened to do the right thing i.e. look after the customer!  Very noisy air conditioning that vibrated through the room all night.  One of those ""run around until you get wet"" showers. Toilet that continually overflowed so running water noise all night.  Breakfast was a complete joke - obviously the staff have been told only to give out a certain amount of things (each plate of items is carefully counted out before serving) but basically it amounted to 6 pieces of potatoes, 8-9 baked beans and 2 (maybe 3) small pieces of bacon (if you choose that option) and a very small portion of scrambled egg or a an omelette. If you eat outside the dining room (which seems like a pleasant idea if it's a nice day - make sure you have bug spray or you will get eaten alive).  No rice available for those who are Asian (it's a staple diet item for Thais - er, and we are in Thailand).  No chance of getting anything more other than perhaps a couple of bits of toast (with absolutely awful jam if you want it) - I even felt guilty having a second cup of coffee!  Such a shame, this place has lots of potential but the owners seem determined to wring every last bit of yield out of it before doing anything about replacing things or fixing things properly - the room I was in had a particularly dangerous electrical socket for the bedside lamp that had ""electrocution"" written all over it!  For the owners: Cushions in the reception area seating were disgusting - please change them!  Spend some cash repairing things and getting things looking better - rusty air con units and broken palisade posts around the pool and other areas just shows you don't care and are determined to milk it for everything you can. It's a lovely place with a great location and you are in danger of messing it up. Stop building new things and instead invest in what you have. Affordable resort located just close enough to all the action and yet in a serene environment. Nice clean room with a comfy bed and a lovely view from the balcony, I couldnt ask for more. The staff are really friendly and catered to our every need. I would definitely come back here again. It was anice place to stay there,clean room and ausome food and helpful staff...beautiful garden and not far from market an beaches....its quiet family type resort and i would recommend this place....excellent üëç Very beautiful hotel, quite place, nice garden, i love the swimming pool Rooms are very need and clean all the staff are nice and friendly we enjoy staying there, would love to come back again.  Thank u Hillside resort. execellent hotel,beach is bypass,i love to walk in market and its nearby,,soo lovely place,i love it,we have enjoy alot,lots of thing to see nearby area,people are gud and loyalty,i relky like it,,,,,, Very beautiful room need and clean. Staff is very helpful. Swimming pool very clean. Beautiful garden and not far from the beach we enjoy stay here. Not far from night market and walking street. Very good!!!! is perfect for a quiet getaway. There is a beautiful garden and all ppl whom work in the hotel, are so nice and respectful. in spite of occupancy was pretty high, it was so silent. I really highly recommend that property according to location ( pratumnak between pattaya city center and jomtien, 5 min to walk tuk tuk route) price (cheap enough) big rooms etc. I had a great stay at Hillside. Was visiting Thailand with a bunch of friends and this resort deemed very sensibly priced. The hotel was moderately big and the rooms were spacious and tidy. I was very anxious about cleanliness but the hygiene standard surpassed my expectations.  I had a great vacation it was super fun. The staff didn't speak much English, however, they were very helpful and gave good advice on things to do nearby such as visiting the Pattaya and Jomtiem Beach and the popular Walking Street which is by the way so close by! There is also a temple completely carved of wood called Sanctuary of Truth, would not have known about this if it wasn't for the lady at the front desk.    Pattaya had lots of nightout options making it a great and happening place to visit for friends. I'd also like to add that being a woman I really appreciate the security and safeness of the hotel.    Definitely planning on going back and staying in this hotel    A pleasantly surprised student,  Lisa First of all, The hotel is old and away from the city. Please considering this before you book the rooms. The good thing is its very quiet in the night. the Staffs are quite Okay...You need to tell them what you wanted and they will provide it for you.  you will need to rent a Motorbike from the hotel, or in front of the hotel at the cost around $3-5 per day (I am not sure) to go the the city or the beach because it's on the Hill.  For me it's reasonable price hotel. If you are a type of person who expect too much  Please don't book this hotel and later complain. dont know from where to start!! no lift, no room service for baggage(2nd floor was the only place they could give us), no decency to reply, pathetic staff who themselves might be staying in the same hotel room with no interest to assist the travellers (""they could live there, they could have food and drinks along with the travellers in the same place where v sit, listen loud music in lobby, and enjoy.. then y bother to assist or even guide anyone"" kinda attitude) their surity is sick. we starved the whole day thinking our driver will stop for food as v requested and staff agreed, yet the driver did not stop anywhere saying he was not informed to do so! talking of the place where it was situated in: literally at an isolated hill with no travel facilities. food boring, place rubbish, rooms not great, service hillarious at some time and unbelievable (obviosly in pathetic way). never ever go to this place! The ""total dump"" review is completely contradictory to our experience. We went there for a holiday with the family and had a great time. The rooms were clean and spacious and the staff were warm and friendly. Its location was a little away from the buzz of walking street but we had kids so it was perfect. Within easy reach of the shopping centers and beach side. booked into this hellhole for one night aircon not working just had the fan spinning inside shower felt like a small bird pissing on my head toilet water ran all night russian disco music 24/7 and mozzies buzzing around your head all night discusting breakfast with chicken sausage they charge 50 bart a day to use there safe youd be better of in prison than this dump Hotel is far from the city centre on top of the hill, walking distance from the Big Buddha, and to local shops (7-11). Check in staff were very friendly and nice, room was very modest, not much to write home about but ok for the night. The room I was placed into had no remotes for tv or a/c, asked if I wanted to be changed down the hall,room not as cold, but remotes. Asked manager to look for remotes while I was gone to city exploring; returned hours later to new female clerk, who tried to tell me I couldn't move, but also didn't understand english all that well, luckily the day clerk came back and had no problem with me switching rooms at that time (730pm).  Computer in front lobby charged 20baht per hour (not bad,less than 1 dollar), breakfast was in beautiful courtyard below, also very minimal but pleasant.  Since hotel is basically in the middle of nowhere so to speak,I would have (if had to do it over), I would have picked a hotel in city centre, where you can walk right outside to the husdtle bustle of any big city life, BUT that's you're preference of course. Remote in country setting or city,I say what I say because when I travel to a place I've never been to I would like to know where actually I'm staying and what's around me to do and see. Your call! Still very nice beach town to go and check out, less than 2 hours from Bangkok. Use Pattaya van out of Victory monumnet, only 97 baht each way, that's about 3 usd, can't beat it! A hotel where you are treated like family. Very cordial staff with comfortable and clean rooms and good food. We were part of a large group and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly with a well planned local tour itinerary and entertainment. Many thanks to Mr.Warren Vaz the MD and his caring team. Incidentally the MD himself was very actively involved in every aspect of hotel hospitality. We the aircrew(retd) of the indian air force had one of the finest holidays of our lives. 33 of us were looked after with so much care n affection, that it was an out of this world vacation. on behalf of all of us, i wish to thank u warren n all ur wonderful staff. pls. convey this msg. to them.wing commander dinky fialho, I, John Merwyn Mr. Anil Patil and Mrs Alena Odud Patil along with my friends stayed at Hillside Resort Pattaya, 305,Soi 2, Phratamnak Rd.,, Pattaya 20250, Thailand Every thing about this hotel was found perfect with no problems at all. The desk staff where great and helpful. Their Manager Mr. Preeda was very helpful, very dynamic and ready to help all times. The owner, Mr. Warren Vaz seems to always be around to say ""hello"" or answer any questions. The Rooms were cleaned every day with fresh bedding. Cleaners would give me extra towels if i asked. To go to places like walking street where the night seems young . Party and night zone.. you can take 10 baht taxi ride. Our next stay will definitely be here. This lodge is not nearby to any attraction in Pattaya, but if you're very familiar with the tuk tuk and the Pattaya area, access to other areas still easy by the uses of tuk-tuk (which price can be as low as 10 baht per head). The room is very old, and only basic amenities available. If you're on budget to travel, and prefer a place to avoid noise from busy street at Pattaya, this can be a choice. Make sure you prepare the map to locate this lodge before you hop on a taxi, as this can be a quite secluded area at Pattaya hill. The location of the hotel leaves much to be desired. Far from everything far from the beach, far from shopping area and restaurants, very isolated. Big rooms, but room service is very poor. Breakfasts is another reason to complain. Every day they serve eggs and only eggs sausages. Same same every day. We stayed for a week at the Hillside Resort - found this place by chance and was very pleased with our stay. The resort itself is clean, has all the basic facilities, quiet family type resort. Despite being in a quiet area it is close to all the Pattaya action -Walking street, beach front etc. I would recommend this place. What a lovely friendly hotel. Pleasant and cheerful staff and situated far enough from the hustle and bustle of the town to be quiet but a hop skip and a jump if ypu wanted the night life.  Warren, the owner was carrying out some works to upgrade the already good rooms and was also just preparing to open the restaurant as we tried out the wares of the chef as part of his interview.  Kanda, Lilly and Shyam were all very pleasant and helpful and made our first trip to Thailand a great experience. Having already given a good review of this hotel, I feel that under their new management, a new review is called for.  I returned from my third stay at the Hillside Resort in January, 2012 but although on my most recent visit to Pattaya in July, 2012 I stayed at a different hotel. I decided to go up to visit my two friends who reside permanently at the Hillside Resort.  I parked my motorbike in the parking area and approached the reception area to visit my friends. However, the new Indian manager of the hotel told me in no uncertain terms that I wasn't allowed to park in the parking area because I wasn,t a guest. I explained that I had stayed at Hillside Resort many times and was merely visiting my friends, who were expecting me.  He was very abrupt and uncompromising and told me that visitors were not welcome to use the parking area - even though it was almost empty, as was the hotel!  My plans to possibly stay there again on my next visit have been scuppered because there is no way I will ever stay there again. I told my friends about this incident and they told me that he had put the prices up since his arrival in March, and that after living there for over 5 years, they are now looking for somewhere else to stay.    Unfortunately, this experience has negated my previous review of the Hillside Resort.    Best wishes and good luck. Located at Phratamnak hill Soi 2..Hillside Resort is about 15 mts. walking Distance from Pattaya beach about 15 mts. by scooter to Jomtiem beach and Walking street.. However, the beach is not really clean early morning. Hotel is clean, Excellent clean n Small swimming pool, Excellent room. Strong wifi. Very spacious. Was not expecting that much space for the price. Not crowded. Owner and front desk person were extremely nice and accommodating. Bathroom was nice. Hot water, plenty of space in shower. This hotel was recently remodeled/updated. Only negative i can see for some people is that it is pretty far from the craziness of Walking Street. But I was looking for quiet plaqce... So it was perfect.if one I wants to hit up the town, it's only approx 250 bht for a scooter. for 24 hours (which is pretty good value for money). Hotel Feature Tip: This is a good place for your holiday, relax and far from Hustle and bustle. Accommodation cost is quite reasonable..... VIVA....RE VIVA... GOOD LUCK.    JOHN N PAUL GOA....from 29th March to April11th. I stayed here for 6 nights and have found myself to fall in love with the courtesy being offered to me. His General manager Mr. Shyam was too helpful and same goes with the owner of the hotel Mr. Warren Vaz. Rooms were good sized and cosy, clean. View from the rooms was soothing. Shall surely chose the same for my next visit. I have stayed at the Hillside Resort twice, and have booked to stay there again in November, The staff are friendly and helpful, and the rooms are clean and of a good size. I usually hire a motorbike as it iis a fair walk from Pattaya and Jomtien.  The main disappointment is the very small pool which is unusually cold for Thailand, being in the shade of the hotel for most of the day.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone, particularly if you are staying for any length of time on a budget. I stayed in this hotel 3 times. It's located on soi 2, Pratamnak hill. Pros : not far from the cleanest Asia Pattaya beach, nice garden and cafe attached, with free pool table. Also, it has a tiny swimming pool, but also the bigger one is available just across the road, at the Pattaya Hill resort. I paid as few as 550 baht for twin bed room, and it even had a bathtub and a balcony ! Another plus is - very quiet at any time of a day, however not far from main attractions, equidistant to Jomtien and Pattaya. Laundry is available as well. This hotel is girlfriendly, only the girl's ID is required on the reception desk, they hold it untiil she leaves.  Cons : Although it's not far from both Jomtien and Walking street, you will need either rent a motobike or use motorbike taxi, parked near FamilyMart shop. I used to pay 60 baht for a ride to soi 6, which is quite fair price. Bahtbuses are extremely rare on this part of the road , you 're lucky if you see one. This hotel is located on top of the hills overlooking Pattaya. To get a sense of its location, Google Sheraton Pattaya Hill Resort. Its located about 5 minutes from there. You are in a prime location without paying the prime prices. It is also 15 minute walking distance to main Pattaya Beach and there are lots of buses that pass by. Here is my take:    Pluses:  1. Affordable rates if you book online  2. Clean swimming pool and clean sheets  3. You can actually sleep at night with the windows open. Unlike beach area pattaya, the hills are quite. This is important because Thailand is a loud place and discos sometimes go all night.    Negatives:  1. Expensive internet-go into town to check your email.  2. One of the clerks is too clever. Tried to charge me extra 400baht for my last night. Fortunately, when checking out, an honest clerk charged me the correct rate.  3. If you are night partier, you will need to take transportation from the beach area. Don't pay more than 100 Baht (regular price is 20-30 baht) but at night, farang prices are in play.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.917124,100.865776&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.917124,100.865776&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.920770,100.866524|12.919580,100.867058|12.916930,100.866753|12.917850,100.867500|12.915430,100.865410|12.917980,100.868912&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.918758,100.869606|12.913967,100.867020|12.915426,100.866028|12.921231,100.866676|12.915284,100.862770|12.915576,100.866371|12.915956,100.862373|12.916930,100.866753|12.914410,100.866608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.913719,100.867088|12.915452,100.862419|12.915844,100.866249|12.916349,100.870102|12.914198,100.867195|12.919668,100.862770|12.916614,100.862007|12.915245,100.862549|12.919222,100.862717&signature=uf8HwOc2eM5lN1ZVPkoWX5yZA2Q=",1.0,Positive
16,"HONEY LODGE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","great value for money , at the beginning of walking st, basic but perfect ,great helpful staff and ideal for shops and bars.  you don't need anything more than that in pattaya.  I stayed at a family friends in korat , it was miles from anywhere , so for the last three nights I stayed at the honey lodge , it was basic but neat with fridge , safe and kettle ,a shower and my room overlooked a pool,I was more than happy staying there and will do it again next time I visit .  thanks staff for a pleasant stay. Bad staff rude lady on night. Been going there 6 year I am pretty sure they gave me worst rooms in hotel night staff.  Never stay again 6 year 1 month each stay. Rooms smell like mould. Had to clean my bathroom as black mould everywhere Never never never again I been in this hotel em NOV.19 for 2 weeks, the location is very good, very good rooms, nice swimming pool, very clean, a beautiful place, a great service with a friendly and helpful staff. I will be back for sure! Selling point is their location. They are located just at the corner of Pattaya's famous Walking Street. Also within walking distance to the beach.Rooms were pretty spacious and very clean and neat. Very satisfied with the room, even had a balcony. Good customer service by hotel staffs too. Strongly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to be within walking distance to everything. My wife and I just spent 6 days and enjoyed it very much. The Staff were doing anything possible to make our time comfortable. The rooms are clean and tidy, a bit small but still ok. Wi-Fi is nearly non-existent but worked some time. The boys set our phones up to Wi-Fi. Close to walking street and all other Entertainment. Only 10Baht to jump on Taxi bus which runs pass hotel and into 2ND street. Pool was clean and refreshing.Western Breakfast can be had at dining room for 150 Baht. which is very good. The only good thing about this place is the location.    The wifi internet does not work at all, the hotel knows about it but does not care to fix it.  They just tell you sorry no internet...    The staff does not say hello to you when you come check in, only the maid was nice to say hello.    When i checked out, not thanks, no bye, nothing.    In the room, no soap, no shower gel, no shampoo for 1 000 bath per night.    So, if you need internet when you stay somewhere, don't go there, there is not internet and the hotel does not care to fix it... Hotel was clean, in a great location, walking distance to all the bars, restaurants and the beach. Wifi was not the greatest but it worked. The pool was nice. The staff was decent. We heard about this hotel from family friends that live in Bangkok. Stayed at the Honey Lodge many times. This time, Saturday, August 9, 2017. Check in without reservations is a breeze. Stayed many times and always seemed like a very clean, quite, and secure location. This time had to change rooms, without incident upon stepping into the room. Smelled like someone stayed there that detested personal hygiene, as in the male type. No, problem got another room. This room was totally sub-par from anything there, room 220 on second floor. The AC continuously cut off during the night. The room was not stocked with its usual sundry of items. I will not stay there again. Again, this is usually the place to stay. The wifi is not free, 150 THB per day. If they would take a little more pride in the place it would get me back. Remember this is a three star hotel when reading my review. The room was clean and the shower room and toilet rooms were well maintained and has a nice pool.Yes, a seperate room with doors for the shower and toilet. The TV was adequate. Check in was fast and with a smile. Location is right at Walking Street and full of bars. Also it is walking distance to the Hau Hin/PATTAYA Ferry and several shopping centers. This is not in my opinion a family area but I was traveling with a pal . We just stopped for the night and headed to our final destination the next day. I would not stay in this area with my wife! Book direct and it's about 300 Baht cheaper. Reception not the friendliest i've encountered. Very mechanical and cold.    Room was boiling hot when i arrived. Air con on. Fine. 2 hours later, spotted ants around the sink. No big deal since i was only there 1 night. Soon after, a huge cockroach appeared around the back of the sink. Quite a game of cat and mouse before it finally departed down the shower drain!    The bed was very firm too.    If you're wanting to be close to Walking street though, this is a great location. Just around the corner and, surprisingly quiet! The amenities at the hotel is good and its location is perfect. but they need to increase the facility they provide. in standard rooms, they don't even give water and coffee maker as complementary and also they don't provide free wifi. Stayed twice here during my 2 visits to pattaya and they also dont accommodate special requests of guests. Well, overall location is fine but cost is high considering the facilities they provide. This Hotel has a nice location as it is located near Pattaya beach nearby walking street. The rooms are clean and I love how there is a separate shower area and toilet area. However, the hotel misses on some very cheap small aspects! First, the hotel does not provide a toothbrush or shampoo! Yes, you read that correctly! Also, it is crazy that one needs to pay for wifi! How about you take that 50 Baht a day you collect for wifi and provide a toothbrush and shampoo that will cost you 20 Baht... Overall, I would stay here again. For a hotel that has taken time to make the rooms nice, one would think they would take care of the little things too. This Hotel is located near Pattaya beach nearby The walking street, just five minutes walk to the beach. The atmosphere is good, free parking, swimming pool. But there is not bathtub, champoo, and hair dryer. Honey Lodge is tucked away behind the main road so its quiet. Its very close to the bars and entertainment venues and the beach . Rooms are clean , modern and comfortable . Safety deposit boxes are available at reception who will also organise travel arrangements. A hassle free stay . Everything works although there is free WiFi only in the non air-conditioned foyer area. There is some free parking and the area is close to the beach, walking street and central shops.    The atmosphere is not typical of the area. Toilet and shower sections work well. The air conditioning is effective and your able to relax within the complex.    Food is not included in the cost and there are plenty of food options in close proximity. If I am staying in Pattaya this is where I prefer to stay as it is sufficiently far from the bars etc that they are seemingly not there. Pros- If you are looking for location, this place is great. It is 1 minute walk to walking street. Come to find out tho, Pattaya in its entirety is a ""Walking Street"". Bars, etc are found throughout the city, so you don't necessarily have to stay near walking street. Just on the beach road somewhere. WiFI is good in room, you do have to pay 50 baht, like $1 us which is nothing.  staff was nice and pleasant.    CONS- pay for breakfast, when it should be included. the room is not great, kinday mildewy and smelly. The view, sucked for me, I had a balcony but it faced the back parking lot which was not a good view.  Had to pay for them to translate a phone call from the front desk, lol 30 Baht. Great little hotel in quite so soi walking street at door I have stayed here 5 or 6 times my local home in pattaya staff great pool great rooms great all over just great.  Look on trip advisor for best rates. Good clean hotel, tucked away in an alley right at the end of Walking Street. Close to the beach. Good value too and the staff are pretty good. Handy safety boxes outside reception and friendly hotel cats (not strays) appreciate some cat treats here and there haha.    It was my second time there and was pretty much the same as before. Clean but in need of a little TLC here and there. Nothing to worry about though. The toilet cistern in my room (319) needed a new float thing inside so unless you open up the top and pull it up, it will just keep filling and filling and driving you crazy with the sound haha. The shower is a little crazy too with one enormous head and a little one. I couldn't work out for the life of me how to get the big one working!    I intend to stay here again on return visits to Pattaya. The location is so convenient and frankly in Pattaya there are some nasty hotels so it was a relief to find this one last year. Annoyed that I had to leave 300 baht deposit in case of damage. Even more annoyed that they want 50 Bhat per day for using wifi in your room, ridiculous in this day and age.  Room clean enough, but there is not a nice feel to the place, wouldn't stay again. Had a great time here at the Honey Lodge. Very central location, near beach and Walking Street. Because it is tucked away you don't have the noise of the main streets just around the corner. My room overlooked the pool and had peep view of the ocean.  Clean modern room with good sized fridge w/ freezer. Honey Lodge is right near Walking Street, action central for Pattaya. Yet quiet. rooms are renovated and entirely functional. Bed is double and firm to hard as I like it.    I didn't really like the bad smells coming up from the shower drain. The reno did not fix any piping. Staff are not outstandingly customer service focussed but do anything you need. My local hotel in Pattaya stayed a few times now much better now we MUST book with Agoda and per pay. no chance of ccard getting skimmed as it other report. i have stayed here a few times my CCard was never skimmed. just a back customer i think. pool is wonderful they even got us 3 rooms on the same floor( ihave tried and many hotels but the first time is has been done) Hotel room is quite small but its location is good if you wanna walk to Walking St. Breakfast is okay but you can get better breakfast from caf√© nearby. It is walking distance to pier if you wanna go to Koh Larn. We stayed seven nights and found it clean and quiet.  Staff where helpful.  Great swimming pool.  Close to walking street and markets.  Get breakfast outside at the ""beer garden""  Many european men with Thai girls. Literally a 30 second walk from the start of Pattaya's Walking Street.    If you like downtown type action, this is a good place. The rooms have all been completely modernised. Some rough finishes if you look closely but worth the price. I didn't bother with breakfast as there are many nicer venues around. The pool is very nice too. Great duck restaurant next door, massage shops surrounding, bars nightlife, the place to stay. Easy to get baht bus to anywhere from here, for 10 baht. 2 friends and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found it very good for the price.  Its located up a little dead end street just around the corner from the entrance to walking street.  They have a very nice pool and that is a real bonus for a hotel with modestly priced rooms in a good location.  Since its tucked a bit away from the main traffic and pedestrian area its very quiet and there's no problem getting a good nights sleep.  It looks like the whole hotel has recently had a makeover as the rooms are fresh and clean and the bathrooms look new and very modern with rain maker style showers and a shower cubicle with a glass door  If your looking for a reasonably priced hotel with a pool in a good location close to walking street then this place is a good choice.  If there was one downside it would be the staff and service as it was just average without being great but I am getting picky now as overall it was very good value for money. I have stayed there three times. Attractive modern building tucked away in a quiet courtyard, very close to Walking Street. Spacious reception area and corridors. Clean modern room with good aircon, hot water and wi-fi (small daily charge). Did not try the breakfast (looked a bit basic) but there are plenty of good cheap cafes and bars nearby. Lift, outdoor pool, English-speaking staff. A very good hotel by any standard and excellent value at ¬£18 a night. I arrived without a booking and there were plenty of free rooms - even though the main internet booking sites said not. The same happened on all three of my visits. So best to call them direct 03842 9716 or email: honeylodgehotel@gmail.com this hotel skimmes your visa card.......take care and only pay in cash. I got caught...and I know I am not the only one. You have been warned....I have informed VISA anyway...and they are well aware of this place. There was a review on here that warned before about paying with card.....but I thought what the hell and paid that way......This is the only transaction made by myself with this card in last 4 weeks as I was away......As with other person it seems they have skimmed card...seemed all fine....but suddenly unusual transactions started to appear !!! DO NOT PAY BY VISA OR ANY OTHER CARD AT THIS HOTEL !!! you have been warned !!! I just stayed there 1 night in Nov 2013, little surprise when the neighborhood look dirty but this hotel is very clean and mordern designed. Walk 2 mins to Walking Street and could enjoy entertainment paradise there :) So many bars and pubs, massage places. Quite far from shopping mall but actually we dont plan to shop in pattaya. Room has been upgraded but of caused it come will additional cost BHT 900/night.Location is the best, walking distance to walking street, beach, shopping malls, jetty to islands, wet market and lot or bars. Just at the entrance of the hotel there is Vans which take you direct to Bangkok which stops at Monument MRT station for BHT 100. Pool is quite deep not safe for children without parents around. Scammers at this hotel reception. Stay away from this place.  I recently stayed at the honey lodge  address 597/8 Moo 10 Nongprue Banglamung, Chonburi 20150.    On the 28 march I handed my credit card to the lady behind the counter to pay for my extra night stay at the hotel. I watched her place the card in a credit card type reader then look at her computer. She then said ""must waiting"" I said ""ok"". Two to three minutes later she said ""still waiting you come back later leave card"". This to me was very suspicious behaviour that she would ask me to leave my credit card with her. I said no and asked for the card back. My credit card had been in this reader device the whole time about two to three minutes. On 29 march around 10am I logged onto net banking and noticed unusual transactions on my credit card I notified the bank immediately and they confirmed that the card had been compromised to the value of around $5000 AUD.  This is the only time I attempted to use the card the whole trip and the only opportunity for someone to copy my card information. I believe that the lady behind reception is coping people's credit card details then returning the card to the owner without a record of a transaction. The bank would have no record of a transaction at the honey hotel yet she has a copy of the card details. A few steps to Walking Street and a major Pattaya intersetion yet surprinsingly quiet. Rooms are rather small and the bed is barely enough for two (but for one it is plenty enough). However some have partial sea view and a balcony. Excellent value if you are not looking for great comfort. The small pool is a welcome sight and may even be usable. Within 2min walking from Walkingstreet and beach road. And smaller hotel that has just been renovated. Actually good value for money. Too bad that they did not put in new towels and bed.    They have a small swimming pool. For the walking-in price I paid breakfast was not included (although I think they did not tell me that at check-in). Never the less, the 100thb for the continental breakfast is a waste of money. Better get an good breakfast somewhere else.    Otherwise the rooms is good, clean and comfortable. Totally renovated,clean,right in the center,just outside of Walking Street,has pool,nice staff that speaks good English,good service,quiet and value for money.Food was good also.I have no complains at all.  I've been many times in Pattaya and stayed in different places.This one is my favorite.It costs 900baht per night and for such a room+pool is great price,especially if you compare with similar price hotels.  I definately recommend it and definately will stay there again! Hotel and pool has just been renovated, so everything is new and of caused the price too, before was BHT 600 now BHT 900. Walking distance to Walking Street where all the bar is, and jetty to another nearby island for BHT 15, remember to bring water and some food to eat or you will have to pay extra price for everything on the island (good far 1 lazy day trip), taxi to Survarnabumi airport at BHT 800 or you can take the shuttle van just front of the hotel to Monument MRT for BHT 100, take another MRT for another station for BHT 15 which will connect you to Airport MRT for BHT 45. Not so hassle but very cheap. Out of the entrance on the left walk straight about 100 meters you will find a big temple and an interesting market with lot of local foods and cheap too. Everything is walking distance to discover.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.934711,100.892021&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.934711,100.892021&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.934132,100.887672|12.934503,100.891907|12.937825,100.892319|12.934280,100.891502&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.934425,100.893944|12.935964,100.888329|12.934770,100.890045|12.931151,100.890053|12.935006,100.891457|12.934615,100.890152|12.935438,100.890152|12.934950,100.891464|12.936825,100.893097&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.938590,100.890793|12.938218,100.891045|12.932687,100.895325|12.937084,100.890457|12.937399,100.891861|12.933731,100.888527|12.938361,100.892754|12.934778,100.888260|12.934186,100.888176&signature=xzKDthfOfjmU00EQIjZ2Z2eib1w=",1.0,Positive
17,"INN RESIDENCE - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","This is a great hotel  We both loved it so much  So welcoming  Close to the beach and other amenities  I strongly recommend this hotel  Has its own kitchenette  Clean room so relaxing  Not far from the beach We spent the first proper nights of our Thai holiday here and what a great few nights they were. This hotel offers great prices, lovely warm staff and a very comfortable room all located in a little side street, 250m from the beach, in the quieter end of Jomtien while still in reach of all the action if that's what you want. The room was nice and spacious and spotlessly clean, the bathroom comfortable and, most importantly, located in the back of the hotel so it was super quiet. On the roof is a charming deck and pool area with spectacular views of Jomtien. The only downfall - the breakfast which is not the greatest. Tip: If you're looking for a quiet drink before or after heading out, look no further than directly across the road. The two ladies from northern Thailand will go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Full marks to all at inn residence , reception and security top ready to help at the drop of a hat.Rooms very clean. Ideal place to stay if you have a small family also in a very quite area to say this is in pattaya is wrong it is in fact in jointiem beach. Large room, reception 24 /24 h, possibility to cook inside the room, italian shower, good price and about 15 minutes from pattaya city by tuk tuk. If you looking for a good hotel for a medium price in jomtien it s the place I was staying in a poor quality hotel nearby and the day after I checked in I discovered this hidden gem. I went in to inquire how much the rooms were thinking they would be much higher than the place I was staying in but I was surprised to learn that it was only a few hundred baht a day more. We checked out of the other hotel and moved to this one immediately. I couldn't fault this hotel in anyway really, clean rooms with comfortable beds and the shower was powerful too. The rooms are decorated well and have modern furnishings. The staff were great too so I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The highlight of the hotel was the rooftop spa which was fantastic, it was great to sit on the rooftop with a beer and watch the sun go down. This hotel is located in a soi next to Jomtien 12 among many guesthouses which taking about 3 minutes walk from the Main Street. There is a convenient store nearby but no nice restaurant around. The room is Good. Next to bed room there is a couch for relaxing. There is a microwave and a washbasin in the room, good for mini party. Towels and hair dryers are provided. Toiletries provided only 1 unit each, including key card.    Also, please bear in mind that there is no view at all from the room. The hotel is peaceful since they do not accept tour groups. Located within walking distant to the beach (about 500 meters). The room is clean and spacious. There's a living room area (with TV and sofa) and small kitchen (sink and microwave) inside the room. The bed is nice and firm. The bathroom is spacious, too. The room has free WIFI.    For hotel facilities, the rooftop pool is quite small. You cannot actually do a swimming there, but perfect for sipping beers and relaxing in the evening (watching sunset, maybe). Breakfast is delicious and cheap (just only 70 Baht per person).    Hotel staff are very attentive and helpful. Definitely will come back! This is one of the most outstanding hotels in the area. Very quiet and relaxing. Staff very helpful and friendly. Hotel is only full bank holidays and weekends. Roof pool quality great views from roof and first class air conditioning. Rooms very good with fast free WiFi. We will be back. Just home from a 12 night stay, hotel was brilliant.  Spotlessly clean, maids in everyday. Large rooms with a fabulous king size bed, a sink, microwave and kettle with tea and coffee, a couple of bottles of water free each day.  The bathroom was again spotless with free toiletries and a large walk in electric shower so constant hot water, however the water to the sink was cold so no hot water for shaving.  The balcony was of fair size but not much of a view, just the front street which was uninteresting I'm afraid.  There is a small sofa and large tv with a few english chanels.  The rooftop pool terrace is brilliant and we were lucky enough to have it to ourselves most of the time. The pool is just a small plunge pool but perfect for cooling off in.  We did have a small issue one day with the pool which we reported to the reception, and to be fair when we returned to hotel after an afternoon out, the problem had been rectified.  I've read in previous reviews that the free wifi is poor, but all i can say is it worked well for me.  All in all had a fabulous stay and would definitely use this hotel again. Although I've given it a 4 i would say 4.5 is more accurate. Booked the suite with my wife and daughter. The suite has a double and a single bed placed well apart from each other. This placing allowed my daughter a little privacy as the single bed is in a small alcove.    There is a large flat screen, music system and microwave. The aircon is good and a large balcony with table and chairs. The room is very new and also has a small sofa and table which is nice.    The bathroom is large with the only small problem is access to get in and out of the shower difficult getting over the bath.    It is on a very quiet soi but only a minute or two to the beach. Baht busses constantly run from the end of the soi with motorbike taxis also available.    Staff very well dressed and polite. Maybe the cleaners could be a little quieter in the mornings talking loudly and their walkie talkies very loud.    Stay again yes for sure. Jomtien and Pattaya again maybe not. Really far up the jomtien road...away from most of the life on the road..  But the beach really is at the bottom of the street..  It's easy to find.    The room is big,has all the amenities it portrays,including the large tv..  The pool is really small but nice...    For the money it's just about ok..  Look out your window you see an old crumbling wall about 2 feet away..  No light gets into the room..which makes it look abit dreary..    When we arrived at the hotel the electric was off..  We spent 5 hours in a sweat box with the kids trying to sleep after a long drive here..  But we put this down to can happen anywhere in Thailand..    The one thing bugged me about this stay was at check in the young lady said that one room had a conformation for 1 person..  The other 2 rooms conformation for 2 people..  In actual fact my booking threw hotels.com was for 3 and 3 and 2 in the rooms..  The site clearly shows that the rooms hold max of 3 ..  I explained all this to her but she kept repeating the same thing..  I did say I could show her online but that the Internet was not working as well as everything else as the electric was off..  I asked her did she want me to phone hotels.com to confirm for her..she said yes..  My wife said to her in thai that would not happen and she would be showed on the booking when Internet was restored..  I was for leaving there and then for another hotel as the heat and nonsense coming from her was making me angry..    End of story was when later my wife went to show her she was not there..  We did not see her over the next 4 days...    Because of the ignorant bull headed attitude of this staff member I or my family or my friends will never set foot in this hotel again..  And no apology for the free sauna for 5 hours either.... The hotel is located in a dirty soi close to the beach. The hotel is new and could be great, but the hotel is badly built, with many ""quick solutions"". Loose faucet, spilt paint on the floor and so on. The beds were like sleeping on the floor. It was the hardest mattress I've ever slept on. The staff is really unfriendly. We never got a smile from them, they did not bother to book us taxis, and most of them did not speak good enough English to work at a hotel. Stayed here for two nights, nice modern boutique hotel with very friendly and efficient staff the hotel is new and very clean the sun terrace and mini pool are great all in all a jem of a small hotel in a quiet soi just 50 yards from the beach and the bars and restaurants just in the next soi New! Clean and nice. Can walk to the beach only 100 m. Nice sofa with flat-screen. Balcony with table and 2 chairs. Cooking zone microwave, refrigerator and sink. Bathroom also clean, shower or bathtub each room. There is a hair-dryer inside bathroom. The staffs are friendly. Love the roof-top pool area. ‚ù§Ô∏è Beautiful roof pool area, new delicius room and bathroom. Very clean. Friendly staff. Only 48 rooms makes this hotel cosy. It's near the beach.

18,"INRAWADEE RESORT - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","It is a cozy truly dog friendly resort with bungalows. We stayed with two large dogs and felt very welcome. The rooms are simple but clean, the staff very friendly and helpful.  The location is good with lots of shops, restaurants and thong to do around. never stay here again!!! Bad experience!!!    I am writing to complain about my staying in Inrawadee resort. couldn't imagine that my staying in this hotel would be so bad.  Low air condition, dirty and there's plenty of insects and bugs in the room.  Disturbed by noise from the other room.  I absolutelly will not recommend this hotel to anyone,futhrmore!!! This resort looked to have everything we would need for out break. This for us included the fact that they allow pets. The resort itself is out of the way and a fair distance from the beach or centre. Accommodation is in wooden chalets in nice wooded grounds, there was a pool and a reception come restaurant / bar which basically hardly opened. This is why I titled this a nearly place, here is a resort, somewhat out of the way with some nice areas to eat and drink in but they are closed. You are forced to do it yourself (which we did one night cooking on the decking by our chalet) or go into town. As most restaurants in town don't like you taking dogs with you there were a number of unhappy dogs locked in chalets whilst their owners went out.  Could be good but poor. I stayed at Inrawadee Resort for 3 nights and did not have a good experience. The staff did not speak English so anything we needed, like clean towels, help in finding a restaurant or booking a taxi to Bangkok we were not able to do through the hotel. There was the biggest spider I¬¥ve ever seen (apart from the ones in zoo¬¥s) in our bathroom. There were cockroaches all over our bed. Somebody tried to break into our room in the middle of the night which was scary because the doors and windows don¬¥t properly close. Overall it was a terrible experience. Ok, the staff is very nice and helpfull. They drive you to the beach if you want to.  But, the rooms are very very basic and small. All in wood, it makes a lot of sound when walking around. The door and windows does not close perfectly.  I booked for 5 nights but only managed to stay one night.  I felt so lonely and depressed.  There is nothing around. Just a long, small road with dogs, barking and following your tuktuk when arriving there.  The place is quite nice, but do not go there if you want to see a lot of people and do a lot of stuff. Go there if you like to be all alone on yourself. Where to begin. Well we first entered the room to see a dead cockroach, in the evening a live one crawled across the bed then disappeared. The next morning the biggest spider I've ever seen was in the shower. My pocket swiss army knife was stolen from the room and they ate lots of our cookies, unbelievable. At 2am someone tried to get in the room, my girlfriends screaming scared them off but only after a full minute of terrifying door rattling. If your life depends on it don't stay here! Stay in the woods or on the beach, anywhere just not here. Really can't believe no one speaks a word of English either. Don't stay here! We stayed for 6 weeks at the resort , sometimes we were the only people there- it got busier at weekends. The bungalows are little wooden huts with aircon- but not in the bathroom. The shower was very good - plenty of water, The reception staff were very friendly. Thanks Jo ! The bungalow was serviced every day so you had fresh towels and clean sheets which was very welcome. The staff were very friendly - one family lived on site near the pool. We hired a motorbike while we were there but it is only a short walk to the main road then you can get a baht bus along the coast road to Pattaya for only 10 baht - great value and to get back the taxi bikes are great fun- you can haggle the price down. In the bungalow you have a safe - you set the code for it. There is a fridge for your drinks and food and we got a bowl from reception - so each morning we had ceral and friut on the veranda and at night - before we went out we had a few drinks- If you but the mossy curls from the 7 eleven shops they keep them at bay. There is a very cute dog we named maisey- she answer to anything really as she is Thai !! The pool was really nice- very clean but take care as you get in - there is a surpise - underfoot !! We will stay there again - Jo has some of our clothes- we ran out of space as we bought stuff to take back !! Apart from that it suited us down to the ground - bu we are very easy going and take everything in our stride - lifes to short to be hung up on stuff - If you want things like at home - stay at home . Thailand is a place to experience and enjoy and never judge- everyone has to survive and live somehow. Enjoy xx We stayed at Inrawadee resort for the week end. The rooms are very simple and basic (small huts) but decorated with a lot of taste. The bathrooms are very badly designed with no space between the water closet and the sink. We did not suffer from mosquitoes although there were holes in the wooden floor. We however slept like babies because the resort is located in a quiet & remote area.    The main problem was that the beach (Jomtien) was relatively far from the hotel (20 minutes walk) with no transportation organized by the hotel. When going to the beach we had to walk first on a small and dangerous road (no side walk) and then on a bigger street. On the way back we used to take local tuk-tuks (song tao) but they would stop at the intersection between the main street and the small road of the hotel, therefore we had to come back walking which is not only very pleasant after a whole day on the beach. It is a cozy truly dog friendly resort with bungalows. We stayed with two large dogs and felt very welcome. The rooms are simple but clean, the staff very friendly and helpful.  The location is good with lots of shops, restaurants and thong to do around. never stay here again!!! Bad experience!!!

The next morning the biggest spider I've ever seen was in the shower. My pocket swiss army knife was stolen from the room and they ate lots of our cookies, unbelievable. At 2am someone tried to get in the room, my girlfriends screaming scared them off but only after a full minute of terrifying door rattling. If your life depends on it don't stay here! Stay in the woods or on the beach, anywhere just not here. Really can't believe no one speaks a word of English either. Don't stay here! We stayed for 6 weeks at the resort , sometimes we were the only people there- it got busier at weekends. The bungalows are little wooden huts with aircon- but not in the bathroom. The shower was very good - plenty of water, The reception staff were very friendly. Thanks Jo ! The bungalow was serviced every day so you had fresh towels and clean sheets which was very welcome. The staff were very friendly - one family lived on site near the pool. We hired a motorbike while we were there but it is only a short walk to the main road then you can get a baht bus along the coast road to Pattaya for only 10 baht - great value and to get back the taxi bikes are great fun- you can haggle the price down. In the bungalow you have a safe - you set the code for it. There is a fridge for your drinks and food and we got a bowl from reception - so each morning we had ceral and friut on the veranda and at night - before we went out we had a few drinks- If you but the mossy curls from the 7 eleven shops they keep them at bay. There is a very cute dog we named maisey- she answer to anything really as she is Thai !! The pool was really nice- very clean but take care as you get in - there is a surpise - underfoot !! We will stay there again - Jo has some of our clothes- we ran out of space as we bought stuff to take back !! Apart from that it suited us down to the ground - bu we are very easy going and take everything in our stride - lifes to short to be hung up on stuff - If you want things like at home - stay at home . Thailand is a place to experience and enjoy and never judge- everyone has to survive and live somehow. Enjoy xx We stayed at Inrawadee resort for the week end. The rooms are very simple and basic (small huts) but decorated with a lot of taste. The bathrooms are very badly designed with no space between the water closet and the sink. We did not suffer from mosquitoes although there were holes in the wooden floor. We however slept like babies because the resort is located in a quiet & remote area.    The main problem was that the beach (Jomtien) was relatively far from the hotel (20 minutes walk) with no transportation organized by the hotel. When going to the beach we had to walk first on a small and dangerous road (no side walk) and then on a bigger street. On the way back we used to take local tuk-tuks (song tao) but they would stop at the intersection between the main street and the small road of the hotel, therefore we had to come back walking which is not only very pleasant after a whole day on the beach. It is a cozy truly dog friendly resort with bungalows. We stayed with two large dogs and felt very welcome. The rooms are simple but clean, the staff very friendly and helpful.  The location is good with lots of shops, restaurants and thong to do around. never stay here again!!! Bad experience!!!    I am writing to complain about my staying in Inrawadee resort. couldn't imagine that my staying in this hotel would be so bad.  Low air condition, dirty and there's plenty of insects and bugs in the room.  Disturbed by noise from the other room.  I absolutelly will not recommend this hotel to anyone,futhrmore!!! This resort looked to have everything we would need for out break. This for us included the fact that they allow pets. The resort itself is out of the way and a fair distance from the beach or centre. Accommodation is in wooden chalets in nice wooded grounds, there was a pool and a reception come restaurant / bar which basically hardly opened. This is why I titled this a nearly place, here is a resort, somewhat out of the way with some nice areas to eat and drink in but they are closed. You are forced to do it yourself (which we did one night cooking on the decking by our chalet) or go into town. As most restaurants in town don't like you taking dogs with you there were a number of unhappy dogs locked in chalets whilst their owners went out.  Could be good but poor. I stayed at Inrawadee Resort for 3 nights and did not have a good experience. The staff did not speak English so anything we needed, like clean towels, help in finding a restaurant or booking a taxi to Bangkok we were not able to do through the hotel. There was the biggest spider I¬¥ve ever seen (apart from the ones in zoo¬¥s) in our bathroom. There were cockroaches all over our bed. Somebody tried to break into our room in the middle of the night which was scary because the doors and windows don¬¥t properly close. Overall it was a terrible experience. Ok, the staff is very nice and helpfull. They drive you to the beach if you want to.  But, the rooms are very very basic and small. All in wood, it makes a lot of sound when walking around. The door and windows does not close perfectly.  I booked for 5 nights but only managed to stay one night.  I felt so lonely and depressed.  There is nothing around. Just a long, small road with dogs, barking and following your tuktuk when arriving there.  The place is quite nice, but do not go there if you want to see a lot of people and do a lot of stuff.

20,JOMTIEN PLAZA RESIDENCE PATTAYA - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Thailand),"Massive room with cleaning and bed changes daily. Really can‚Äôt fault the room and the staff. The pool is not the best but being so close to the beach, there is no reason to be at it. The restaurant is good but better food elsewhere. Our room faced the lobby of another hotel and there were a lot of coaches at all hours of the night but not the hotels fault. Would recommend and would stay again. I booked it over Agoda for 10 nights,  we arrived and I see the room ( junior-suite ) and I was shocked, complete shocked!  All is very old, the maximum is only 1 star!    If you wanna have a shower, forget it because the whole bathroom is under water because the water go to the wrong side !!!    Everywhere is a terrible smell!    We changed the room 3 times but everywhere is same same !    It could talk many hours about it, I just can say don‚Äôt book it !    You get for 1000 baht in pattaya and Jomtien a lot of really good rooms for 1 Night!    I booked it I pay 380 Euro for nothing  because we go to an other hotel !    A lot of Russian guests there, I can see they like it really but I don‚Äôt know where they live at home?!    I can really not understand how anyone can like something there ?!    So thank you for nothing Jomtien Plaza !!! I stayed here for 2 weeks. Had a large deluxe room, massive bed(2 3/4 beds pushed together), it had a flat screen tv with a massive range of channels, a fridge, tea and coffee facilities, great air con, and a balcony with a limited sea view.  Bathroom was showing signs of age but had a toilet, shower, and basin. it also had a hair dryer but I didn't use it.  WiFi worked throughout the hotel( In room, lobby, by the pool). Reception staff are friendly and welcoming. Ate in restaurant a few times. Thought food was great - freshly cooked and good value.  This is not a 5 star hotel and does have some minor faults but it's close to the beach really handy for baht buses and amazing value for money. I stayed here a while back and loved it. It has a reasonably priced minibar. Great Barbecue, nice swimming pool nice size fridge. You are far enough from the action but close to get where you want to go in a moments notice. Its very guest friendly for solo travelers or anyone that entertains guests. I had a very good time and this is a go to for me. Stay here if you are on a budget or even if you are not. Its number 3 in my Pattaya Top 5 hotels. The food is of very poor quality and the service is no better. Cold rice and chicken as tough as old boots. I also had the so called American breakfast once at 150 baht, ok cheap but, only thai food so how can they calk this an American buffet. My advise, find somewhere else to eat. Well, first of all. There is a noise bus stop right outside the hotell. It stinked up the hole area. Not only one, but 7 ! And they did`nt even bother to shut down the engines after a while ! Disgusting ! The staff of the hotel where not nice at all ! In perticular the tall female waitress in the restaurant. Seemed like she hates white people all though we gave a good tip. The room was not nice either. Had`nt been cleaned properly and the bathroom was a disgrace. I would not recommend this hotel even to my worst enemy. What a dump of a place Stayed 1 more time with my wife and children, chose for location near to beach and has decent car parking, check in seems to take for ever as staff seem to be unable or untrained, had 2 bedroom apartment which was totally without any cutlery, cups, saucers, plates etc , so what is the point of giving a kettle , room was starting to look tired and needs redecorating and replace some furniture , room price incudes breakfast which leaves more than a little to be desired . if you need to stay in Jontien on a budget , it's ok for 1 maybe 2 nights The hotel is a bit tired, The bathroom are poor. Our family has three room and all three rooms the back sliding glass door were not locked. The room was large but not furnished well. The hotel caters to Eastern European tour groups just some basic information The front desk is not a pleasant experience. Breakfast buffet was not well stocked nor product replenished in a timely manor. If you are looking for a in expensive room to lay your head, it fills that need I had a tremendous nasty stench of feces in the room coming out of a drain pipe in the bathroom. Room was also full with mosquitos and creeping insects. The TV set was old with a bad image. Air conditioning was old too, very dirty and extremely noisy. No mini bar, no black out curtains, not even a waste bin. No bedside tables, no lamps or light switch at the bed.    My room was on the backside of the building, where was something like a bus terminal or garage with corresponding noise disturbance.    In the bathroom no exhaust fan, no shower door or curtain, no bath amenities, not even a simple piece of hand soap.    This hotel advertises with ‚ÄúFree WiFi in all rooms‚Äù and a ‚ÄúFitness center‚Äù. This is just a big scam! The WiFi wasn‚Äôt working at all, not in the room nor in the whole building! The so called fitness center is basically just a multi function fitness tower. But this tower is totally unusable because all wire cables were ripped! There was also no air-con in the fitness room. Therefore it‚Äôs not only far too hot in there to work out, but one will have the company of plenty of mosquitos as well.    Restaurant staff was rude and ignorant and had practically zero English skills.    Complaints about the not working WiFi and useless fitness center led to nothing. I didn‚Äôt even get an apology.    I recommend: Do not stay there! Stayed there last night in room c308 , check in took forever , as receptionist would disappear and serve someone else or continually answer telephone only 2 towels for a family of 4 , 2 hours later after 3 phone calls they arrived , air con in main room did not work , only facilities in room was a kettle and 4 glasses no cups . cutlery or anything you would expect VERY POOR choose somewhere else I had to find somewhere to stay for 5 days at the very last minute. I chose this place because of its location and by some friends going in and looking at a room for me. They said it was ok and booked it for us. On arrival we were given a room in block C. This is very near the road and very noisy. On being shown the room the handle fell off of the sliding door to the balcony. We then looked at 3 other rooms - each slightly worse than the last. We finally ended up in Block A (which is quieter). It was basic (which I didn't mind) and we were so tired we needed somewhere. The next day I looked round the room and found the cupboards were filthy, the bathroom was old, tired and dirty, the hot plate was filthy and there was not a chair to sit on in the room but two dining chairs on the balcony. Even though their was a kitchen area we didn't have any plates, cutlery or cups. The reception staff are rude and tend to ignore you unless you pointedly ask them a question. The concierge was helpful up to a point - when I asked why I couldn't get on wifi in reception (there is none in the room which is disgraceful in this day and age) all he said was ""I'm on"" and went back to the game he was playing on his phone!! The breakfast was quite good (as long as you don't want a European breakfast) but everything was cold. The shining star was the lady who did the omelettes, she was kind, courteous and great at what she did. On check out the receptionist managed to not say a word to me which I found incredible as she had to give me money back for the 500 baht deposit on the key, check I hadn't stolen anything (you have to sign and pay deposit for everything here) and get me to sign out.    The good points: Location and omelette lady.  The bad points: No wifi, rude staff, badly decorated rooms and general lack of care.    If you have to stay somewhere and their is nowhere else left, you should be ok. Don't expect too much and don't stay their for a long time. Block A and B are better than Block C (which is next to the main road) and try and get as high up as you can.    All in all, not the best nor the worst experience of a hotel I have had, but pretty close. Arrogant staff and not good service. I lost the receipt for the deposit paid. and I did not get your deposit back. They know that I had paid the deposit. Room was good and clean. but very bad service! Not  recommended hotel! Massive council estate styled complex surrounded by noise and rip off prices except seafood restaurant 5 kilometers down the beach and country club pub other than that I would save your money and not go, ignorant reception cattle grid style of eating with rude approach to guests rooms are large but very basic lift works but many rooms grid locked at a guest ok for Russians This hotel doesnt work of several reasons.  The cleaning doesnt work. When we checked in, the floors were only sweeped, not cleaned, and same with toilet. Also, during our 10 days stay, the toilet wasnt cleanced ONCE, neither was floor as they only swept it. The bedsheets wasnt cleaned very often, maybe 2 times during our stay.  The AC was making more noise than a broken engine.  When the drain in the shower clogged, we called the reception, which promised to fix it. Nothing was done after that, so for our last 5 days we had to shower in a flooded bathroom, and had to buy towels ourself which we used to keep the floor somewhat dry.  The rooms do NOT have Wifi/internet as promised on site. Also, the wifi in the reception was a laught, slow as a turtle IF it worked. As soon as more than 4-5 people was on it on the same time, you got kicked out of the wifi.  Hotel is packed with grumpy russians, making the whole stay pretty unpleasent. Some of the staff are nice, but the service is below expected.  The pool is ""ok"", but bring your own towels and its not recommended for kids. Also there are no umbrellas/shady area by the pool, which also is on top of the restaurant accessed by stairs, so you have difficulties if handicapped or with strollers.  The breakfast was junk. The hot food was cold and the cold food was hot. Coffee cups was dirty. The restaurant (where the breakfast is served) is under roof but no walls, so birds fly in and out and drop their droppings even in kitchen area.  We asked for a baby cot, which we got after 3 days nagging!  Towels looked like a rarity, we were 2 adults and 2 kids, and all we got was 3 even we asked for more. We had to buy toilet paper as we only got 1 roll whenever it emptied.  The tap in the sink in the bathroom was loose.  TV with mostly noise.  The site said ""kitchen area"" in room which was why we booked this hotel. It didnt have it. Location is very good and practical. Close to taxis, few bars and 7 eleven and also close to jomtien beach. No beach view rooms. Room we got was not cleaned properly. There were bugs in the room. Front desk people have pathetic attitude. The restaurant is pretty good. Good food and good service and good prices. I won't go back there. In same price range one can get much better places to stay. I think they have a policy called CUSTOMER NO SERVICE. I stayed at this hotel from December 22, 2013 until January 1, 2014, and I regret every single day. Unfortunately, the booking was through Agoda, and hence, no refund was possible. About everything in this hotel is bad. I am not overly critical, but here is a list of the deficiencies:    I paid almost 100 USD/night in a so-called ‚Äújunior suite‚Äù and expected a minimum standard. This hotel fails in virtually all categories.    The only good thing first:  Rather quiet location (except for some neighbors). Beaches and entertainment areas reachable within few minutes by collect taxi. Nice balconies.    Bad:  Only rudimentary room furniture.  One of the rooms in the ‚ÄúJunior suite"" is almost empty  No suitable working area for computer  Antiquated mini TV sets. One of 2 was not working  No in-room safe  No minibar  Suitcases must be placed on the floor  Too hard pillows  Only two (2) towels, despite 2 bathrooms. More only upon request  No sanitary bags  Electrical switches in inconvenient locations  Free internet only in hotel lobby, but often down  Internet in room costs additionally - despite high room rate  Internet in room useless, incredibly slow, emails not accessible  Poor maintenance of public facilities: dirty elevator, door repair not made  Breakfast included in rate, however lowest standard  Poor housekeeping: room not cleaned for two consecutive days, despite clear sign and request  1 of 2 bathrooms was never ever cleaned and trash basket not emptied  No consistent supply of daily water bottles    I confronted management with my total disappointment. However, since full stay paid in advance through Agoda, no early departure or refund possible. Eventually, I negotiated a free voucher for the internet in the room. However, as mentioned above, the internet in the room is totally useless, and cannot even be used for replication of emails. Beware if you pay for this ""service"".    Recommendations:  1. For potential guests: avoid the hotel by all means  2. For hotel management: to drastically improve management quality  3. For Agoda: to drop this hotel, until improvement is verified on location  4. For me: never book through Agoda anymore, if full price must be paid in advance. I want to keep the option of early departure in case of such terrible facility and service. Hotel is perfectly located (200 m from the beach, just opposite Jomtien plaza with big number of restaurants and bars). Big rooms (we stayed in 2-bedrooms appartment, about 90 sq m!)  Nice parking lot (free), free in-room wifi. Service is normal for apart-hotel  Only one disadvantage - a lot of people)))) Plaza. Resident condominium is positioned well for touring around and just a stretch more than a walk from beach, set in beach road the plaza is very big and a lovely open air buffet breakfast room which caters for multi nationals,walking distance for a outside stroll the bard and restaurants not too far from night food market and easy reach of Pattaya The rooms were average and sparsely furnished. The service was fairly average and the food choices limited. There didn't seem to be any staff around. View from room was facing another building due to the room being at the back of the hotel. Got talking to a person at the pool who told me that quite a few of the rooms in this condotel were privately owned and were much more comfortably furnished and better looked after and that a lot of looked out to the front of the building towards the pool than most of the rooms run by the ""hotel"". I also learned that these rooms were cheaper by far to rent through an estate agent if you were staying for a couple of weeks or a month. Wish I had known that earlier as the price the hotel was charging was rather high I thought. Next time I will look into the estate agencies. We booked in advance via a friend who went there personally to book. When we got there the booked room was not available, all they had was a damn expensive family room. That room was more of a flat, and looked very dated (1980s). As for our booking we had three reception staff argue that with us, and they all lied outright to us. Also claimed that the girlfriend of the friend who had booked for us had never been to the hotel, despite her having met us there and come up to check out the room with us. Which the staff all saw. It was surreal. We only stayed the one night since it was too late to find another hotel. First thing in the morning we left.    The hotel was otherwise full of mainly Russians, and as far as we could see was not being maintained. Looked like the owners were squeezing as much money out of it without spending any. It wasn't as clean as you would expect either. Worst was the price of the room. Totally outrageous at over 4000 baht. Old and smelly. Bathroom had funges and rotting. Hard bed. I was very disappointed with this hotel. I regularly sttay in thailand and thought I would try something different....what a mistake!! upon arrival they took me to a room that still wasn't made up and the balcony looked directly into a bus parking area at the back with the buses running with their exhaust going staight into the room if you left the door open. After a struggle they changed my room but were not very happy to do it. The food in the restaurant is wll below standard and i ended up eating from a food cart on the streeet at the front of the restaurant most of the time.  they even messed up the taxi that they werre supposed to organise for me to get to the airport early in the morning on my last day and almost missed my flight. the reception staff werre not helpful at all.  DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!! My wife and I booked this hotel as part of our extended honeymoon. We were not expecting anything fabulous but it was reasonably priced and not too far from the beach. When we checked in it took too bell boys to show us to our room (even tho we had one small bag). They nearly knocked us over to rush into the lift before us. We got to our room and it was big enough however it looked like it had hardly been cleaned. It had the towel folded into an elephant alright and the bed was made but the floor was sticky and the tiles in the bathroom fell the wrong way so when you had a shower the water flooded the bathroom and made an island of the toilet for hours. My wife (who speaks thai)had to call reception and ask them to have it redone. This was after our request for a room change was denied until the following morning. In the special request I put that it was our honeymoon..My reward from Jomtien Plaza was a room with two single beds. They said they were full and i could not change until the following day.    The next morning we got to breakfast at 9.40 and the breakfast went until 10. They were obviously trying to run out the food. I looked around and realised that none of the hot food, cold food, stir-frys had any nets or lids over them and they'd been there 3 hours. It also looked as though all the flys in Jomtien beach also had coupons to this breakfast. They had ran out of butter for the 3 days we stayed. All guests were served dry toast    The next day we finally got our room change so that we might share the same bed on our honeymoon. It stank of cigarettes. We just opened all the windows. This new room had a kitchenette. The bench top was dirty, the kitchen sink still had bits of someone elses food in the sink hole. I think the staff here truly believe that cleaning a room is just folding a towel into a swan and putting it on the bed.    A bit of a survival tip. After a shower dry yourself with your t-shirt and use your towel to cover the bed, the linen is about as clean as the floors.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.900000,100.869446&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.900000,100.869446&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.901447,100.868690|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.903545,100.869637|12.901821,100.869125|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.897036,100.868607|12.899477,100.865768|12.896251,100.869408&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.900798,100.865463|12.897312,100.871132|12.902089,100.869385|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118&signature=Kh91WaA4TBqaF4OnZyX1UJtNmgY=",-0.9955,Negative
21,"KILKENNY BAR AND GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","Good bar to visit, in the centre of the nightlife in LK Metro. Daily food specials (Lamb Roasts, Fish & Chips etc) Good value, big portions, resonably priced drinks. Good service and has some nice friendly Ladies! Sports on TV screens, Pool table, cheap breakfasts (I did`nt try these) Good place to, people watch and chill out before hurrah`in the town! I've been here for a few visits and typically in sync with what's on offer with the daily specials. In particular the curries and Friday fish n chips (see my You Tube) which are excellent, are a favourite. You can also just pop in for a cuppa and watch the always curious on-goings in LK Metro and or sport, too. This is a good bar in great location...drink prices are reasonable and breakfast really good ...however a lot of people , tourists and long term residents come to play pool but the condition of the table and the cues is a disgrace ...unless the owner spends a little money recovering the beer stained cloth on the table and getting some decent cues a lot of customers will soon find bars  that have much better equipment This bar is in Soi Metro and is very convenient for Central Pattaya, there is food available and good prices and the staff are good and very attentive. There is Pool table and we wanted a game, but the table was being hogged by a group of men who seemed to use the bar lots.    I asked if we could have a game and was told no despite having my name down for over two hours. We left and returned the following day to find the same group playing again. We had food and left to go to another bar to play pool. We had a look at the rooms there and they seem clean and large and would have no problem staying there. I have not stayed at the guesthouse but I have started going to the bar and restaurant with frequency. Although I do not play pool, they have a very nice pool table. The prices of the food and drinks are very reasonable and you do not have to buy two drinks at a time like the place across the street. The seating in the bar is very comfortable and there are many nice TVs to watch sporting events. There is always a lot of action in front of the bar which is great for people watching. They have great nightly dinner specials. The pork chop and the seafood spaghetti are very good. Last night I went there with my Thai lady for dinner and drinks.  When I got there I put my name on the board to play pool, but they didn't let me play because I didn't pay the lady in charge of the pool table and I didn't buy a drink for her, after I start complaining about this they told me to leave and not to go there again.  But as they advised free pool table,  Bunch of crap. This place offers an Aussie burger, complete with bacon, egg, beetroot and pineapple. It makes for a big feed. A cold beer completes the meal.  The location allows for some great people watching in a busy soi. This bar sums up all that is wrong in Thailand , whilst I can‚Äôt go too specific please believe me when I say that this is possibly the worst bar in Thailand .  So many illegal activities it is a matter of time before the authorities realise .  At first looks , it is a large bar, free pool and decent food but scratch below the surface and all its anomalies come to light . This place is some of the best Thai food I‚Äôve had in Thailand . The Penang curry was very Spicey!. Beer was cheap!. Great place to enjoy cheap food and do some good people watching. Great place to go with a group of friends before heading out for the evening . Free pool table but so popular you should be able to book for the next day.  Breakfasts, good enough. Other food good but pricey.  Bar-staff at night, efficient and charming!  Bar-staff in day time - bit grim but nice enough.  Beer good and reasonable price, and no deafening ""band"" rattling the ice in the glasses. So... went to try the Kilkenny‚Äôs sunday roasted lamb... I visited first time the venue, if not the Breakfast Pattaya club Facebook group, I wouldn‚Äôt think to try, to be honest the place is.. hmm... modest and tired... not to mention the ‚Äû raw ‚Äû style service... The portion of the meat was similar, what I witnessed last week in Robin Hood and it was served with the very nice, thick gravy on already... I know some don‚Äôt like it on this way, but as a marketing tool, understandable... No chewy bites, but some drier ones... the slightly fatty parts ‚Äì I like so much - were easy edible, but still almost no lambish flavor... The yorkie concept was something different I met until now, but I liked it very much, exceptionally good texture and taste for my taste... On the other side I don‚Äôt liked the one whole baked potato idea, I ate only the fried skins, left the centre on the table...anyway, there was no any problem with the potato, just my very own taste... my friend for example liked it... The veggies were good and nice variety, especially with the ultra tasty mint sauce I fallen in love...    Roasted lamb: 199 baht, Water: 35 baht I had the pork chop special in the restaurant of Kilkenny Bar & Guesthouse on LK Metro. For the price, it was a good meal. By Pattaya standards for Western food, it was quite cheap considering portion size, quality of ingredients and skillful preparation.    It was a substantial chop, not thick but large. It came with mashed potatoes, gravy and vegetables. The portions of mash and veggies were larger than you usually get in Pattaya restaurants. Bottled beer is also very reasonably priced at Kilkenny, so I got a filling meal for less than I would usuallyspend for a Western dinner in Pattaya.    The pork chop had been fried nicely and had a lot of flavor. The vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli and carrots) hadn't been boiled too long and tasted quite fresh. The mashed potatoes were excellent and the cook hadn't skimped on the butter, that's for sure. The gravy was the weakest link; not much flavor and too salty. Thankfully it came on the side in a gravy boat and not on the plate. I left the gravy alone and tucked into the rest with an occasional thought to Kenny McCormick and South Park.    I ate at Kilkenny around 10 p.m. and it was busy. About 80% of the seats were taken inside and out. Kilkenny is an open-front restaurant and many of its seats provide an excellent vantage point for people watching.    Bottom line: I won't hesitate to try another special at Kilkenny. The rest of the menu wasn't particularly inspiring, the usual collection of pub food and Thai standard dishes. the breakfast is nice here and the bar is nice, good to sit up front watching world go by. service is ok. 145 bht for breakfast. sports on tv. nice spacious bar pool table live band on sometimes. recommend for food especially breakfast and quite drink. in good location can see up and down soi lk metro. Located in Lk Metro on the corner opposite the Billabong and I Rovers . had breakfast here a couple of mornings, good food . at night it is a good bar , cheap beers, friendly staff, good for ppl watching as they go up and down LK. pool tables, has rooms upstairs but didn't stay , I think it would be very noisy from bar below and street noise. I can't say anything overly negative or positive about this place. The food was good enough and the price was ok I guess, the service is better than the Retox though. but if you're after better food, better portion and better price you're better off at the Retox. Situated in Soi LK Metro opposite I Rovers Bar. I have been here twice now for an excellent freshly cooked Full English Breakfast inclusive of toast tea and orange juice for 145 Baht. Sausages are meaty and bacon is proper back bacon. The staff were friendly and welcoming and it was full of customers. There was a full sized pool table and many Tv screens showing sports. Free wi fi is available. Very good for price,right in the middle of things going on, loud music from about 4 in afternoon till early morning, food good, clean place,staff really friendly. Sheets changed everyday if you wish, short walk to beach where you have restaurants bars malls, something going on purity well everywhere . We have tried breakfast in most of the popular places around the LK Metro area and this was as good as any.I must make a mention of the excellent staff there were 4 of us each changing something slightly with the breakfast no black pudding for one hash browns instead eggs over easy for another tea coffee,and the waitress got every breakfast right this must be a first in Thailand, food arrived hot in a short space of time at 135 baht for a large breakfast slightly dearer than other establishments in the area but over all I think it was worth it. As was described by another reviews the athmosphere is amazing good. Nice staff, amazing tasty kitchen (Here is the best Tom Yam soup I ate this trip!). Good service (you can take fresh towels and other staff in the corridor if you need). Good location - LK Metro !    The Room was superior one (4th floor - the biggest room with private balcony) View from the balcony is good one for ""Solo tourist"". But the room itself was not good one. First issue: bad smell from bathroom which fill all the room (everyone you invite to the room is shocked). Second - the door between room and bathroom is transperent and light is fallen directly to the bed - it is not good to sleep without a mask (Thanks Turkish airlines for the mask :) ). And the last - the furniture is about furniture in the room :) seems it requires replacement (not sure it can be repaired). WIFI in the room is not stable one (good in bar) Ah, near to forget. The private save in the room was closed and noone knew the code. it was replaced to new one next day but it was not easy to explain that I want my estate save    I'd suggest staff to improve English ;) This place is smack bang in the centre of the Bukhao area and offers good music on some nights with a great little band and free winner stays on pool, the beer prices are reasonable and the staff happy and helpful.  I have not stayed here as I feared it may be a tad too noisy but the room price was good I recall and the food was both tasty and value for money.  A wee tip, If you order the 149 baht full English breakfast it comes with juice and a hot beverage (tea or coffee) I would immediately place the little butter carton alongside your hot beverage to soften so as to be able to spread it when your toast arrives with your breakfast. I give this place 8/10. The staff are friendly and the full English is very good value for money, my only gripe is the food isn't served on heated plates and with ceiling fans every where your food gets cold very quickly, this bar would certainly be 10/10 if it was air conditioned as most forign locals prefer I've have eaten here few times, but only for breakfast, food is good, Full English Breakfast, has pool tables & a band at night , it gets busy during the night , cold beers good music. friendly staff.i never stayed in rooms upstairs. ( think it may get too noisy at its right in middle of LK Metro, lots bars and GOgo's . Went here every morning to have the best full English breakfast in Pattaya it is also great value. Small or large you get sausages, great eggs, bacon, fried tomato, mushrooms, baked beans, black pudding or hash brown, tea/coffee, orange juice and toast with butter jam and marmalade.    You also get a choice of cereals and sandwiches - nothing is too much trouble.    All extremely excellent quality and served up by the most amazingly friendly staff.    Located in LK Metro area you need to make sure you go here if you enjoy a tasty cooked breakfast and the lunch choices are just as good.    The prices are reasonable and the company wonderful. Smack in one of Pattayas top night-life districts on LK Metro Kilkenny's offers good food, big screen TV for sport, a very very good Filipino band performing at night. If you are into playing pool then there are plenty of good players here ready to test your game as well. My room, at the time of staying was rather run down, the light in the bathroom did not work and the safe, something I regard as essential in Pattaya was at floor level making access very difficult. The bed was comfortable and that was a real plus. I have hunted down the best full English breakfast in Pattaya after 18 months of searching and at THB 120 ($4) it is also great value. 2 sausages, 2 eggs, 2 bacon, fried tomato, mushrooms, baked beans, black pudding or hash brown, tea/coffee, orange juice and toast with butter jam and marmalade. All excellent quality and served up by really friendly staff. Some may argue that the Irish Rovers just across the road is cheaper at THB99 but trust me it is isn't as good.  Located in LK Metro area just off Soi Diana - make sure you head there if you enjoy a tasty cooked breakfast Tried to book a room but it was full, however I drank in the bar every night as they have a fine inhouse Filipino 3 piece girl band that know ton of songs. I went for a good hearty brekfast most mornings, I even had one at 4pm once. They do a great English style Indian curry. I tried every flavour. Vindaloo was my fav. I was gutted one night when the kitched was shut . This seem to happen about 11pm but the manager told me they are planning on putting a food shack outside so I can get my curry fix at all hours. See you next year guys. You know who I am. The vindaloo man stayed here for 3 weeks i really enjoyed it although its loud till 4.00 am the staff are good  the rooms are basic but very clean comfy bed hot water cannot complain 800 baht a night what would you want The Kilkenny Bar and Guesthouse is ideal for both a longterm stay or just a weekend away from home. The staff is friendly and helpfull with a cool guy as Manager keeping all things together. He is also there to help with what ever issue you may have and he never runs out on hints about what to do and where to go.    The Guesthouse is located on Soi LK Metro, one of Pattayas centers for nightlife, fun and action. Basically you can just stay on Soi LK Metro, everything you are looking for in Pattaya is available here. Restaurants, Bars and you can also choose from many many different nighlife spots Pattaya is so famous for. Soi LK Metro is surrounded by Soi Bukhao, Soi Lenkee and Soi Diana, all just as entertaining as LK Metro itself.    Being a guesthouse there is no such nonsense as a gym or a pool, but never mind because the beach is just a 10min walk away with all the water and sports activities you can imagine.    Room and Bar prices are on the lower end of the scale with the service being exactly what you would expect and need, with a Thai smile provided at most times.  The rooms undergo a tastefull upgrade at the moment. Rooms provide all you need like king size bed, fgridge with minibar, aircon, TV with international cable TV, room safe and ensuite bathroom with hot/cold shower.  On occasional nights you will be entertained with cool live performances. To top it off a professional pool table is available as well to test your skills and there is always an opponent to challenge. I stayed in Rm34/3rd floor - prebooked 2 months in advance as I wanted this room.    Large rectangular room with large separate bathroom with shower & toilet at separate ends. Wardrobe, dresser, lounge + chair, bedside light, flat screen TV, fridge (stocked with drinks), good aircon & safe. Balcony with round table & chairs overlooking both directions of LK Metro running full length of the room.    Cleaned daily, no problem leaving my laptop, camera, coins on the dresser though I believe the occasional tip ensures good service. Only 2 minor points, firstly no power point in the bathroom for shaving (but this is common in guesthouse accom. throughout Thailand, and secondly, expect to hear music until 3am though this wasn‚Äôt a real problem to me as my bedtime was usually between 2-4am. Keep in mind that there is no lift so if stairs are a problem.......    I paid (low season) 700 baht per night + 1000 baht key deposit. As I stayed for 1 week I was given a 750 baht voucher for Champagne Agogo. A solid option if you want to be in the heart of the action. This place has gone down hill fast from the days when the big Irishman used to be the owner    I stayed in the top room 44 the executive deluxe,  The furnisher is sad and broken And there was a problem with the TV all cable channels in Thai, when I complained they fixt it the Thai way when I was out .    On my return the one and only English Channel they gave me was Aljazeera TV  The floor in the room was dirty my feet where black    Moved out after 2 days, I intended to stay 10 days I stayed at the Kilkenny Inn, a Guest House / Bar located in the entertainment area of Central Pattaya, for 2 weeks in July 2011. When I arrived at the hotel, I was introduced to the Manager; a friendly tattoed Englishman in his mid 30s called ZAK. He showed me to my Standard Room and said that if I have any problems, I should contact him. The room itself was great considering that I was only paying Baht 550 per night. It was well decorated and had a good bed and shower room.    At the start of my second week on one particular day, my room wasn't cleaned. I went downstairs to the bar and asked for Zak, the Manager. The cashier then told me ""we no have Zak work here"". I then reminded her that she had introduced me to him the previous week. She then insisted ""we no have manager Zak work here|"" and walked away from the bar. I then spoke to one of the bar staff about the cleaning problem with my room, which they promptly rectified.    Later that evening, I was talking to an ex-pat in the bar. I told him about the cofusion with the Manager Zak and his apparent disappearance. The ex-pat told me that Zak had been working there illegally and had to leave as he had reason to believe that the Immigration Police were onto him. He also told me that the owner employs several Burmese cleaners who were also working contrary to the term of their Immigration visas.    To conclude, I feel that the Kilkenny Inn is a well run Guest House with fair nightly rates. However, by employing the likes of Zak and the Burmese cleaners they run the risk of being raided by the Thai Immigration Police at any time. Most law abiding tourists would not want to experience the embarassment and humiliation of being at the Kilkenny Inn when such a raid takes place.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930218,100.884605&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930218,100.884605&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833|12.930730,100.881668|12.930730,100.881668&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.931198,100.886253|12.930580,100.886002|12.929532,100.885391&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.930844,100.888718|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446&signature=_nzv6r93VOI_99-HhFTxvtHM39s=",1.0,Positive
22,"LAWINTA HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","The LawinTa Hotel is simply superb. It sits in an elevated position, adjacent to the busy Rompho Market, in the middle of a quiet side street off the main arterial road, in and out of town. I found it was an easy walk to the beach. I also enjoyed a 'sea glimpse' from my spacious studio room, with its modern and funky decor, another pleasing aspect to my stay here. The magnificent rooftop pool with it's panoramic views of the city and the water, was a major highlight of an all-round positive accommodation experience. I went for many swims (and breakfasts - do try the in-house restaurant) during my short stay. If you are looking for a comfortable, mid-range place to stay in Jomtien (?), then I suggest that you put LawinTa Hotel (see my Coffee Chill TV YouTube Video) on your short list. I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights because it was selected by the tour. This hotel was about 10km from downtown that was not so good. Buffet breakfast was also not so much options. Fortunately, the room was clean and quiet. The reason why this hotel is so good is because the hotels own description IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU GET. No lies No photo shopped photos and 99.99 per cent of the staff were so polite, kind and helpful it was amazing. Is it a 3 star or 4 star hotel i don't care it offered 5 star treatment. Rooms clean and FULLY equipped with all anybody would need . As i have been visiting the Jomtein area for more than 30 years i have stayed at lots of different hotels but my future home will be Lawinta Hotel on my 3 visits a year. Its a 7 minute walk to the beach which i did everyday . Whatever you need , food shops restaurants etc are all available nearby. Yes they cater for groups of Chinese tourists but this was not a problem or had any effect on how much i enjoyed this Hotel. Thank you Lawinta for being such a lovely place to stay for my 15 days. See you again soon. Part one -  So far we stayed 1 week and are going to stay 3 weeks more. The hotel is worth the money. Service minded both in reception, restaurant(breakfast) and housekeeping. The room have a good bed size, comfortable, good size room and clean. The hotel is quiet new but already we can see that it needs abit freshing up. That is normal in Thailand I think from experience. French balcony. Pool in 8th floor is good but miss a bar. I guess it‚Äôs possible to order from restaurant 1. Floor. Only 5 sun beds. Breakfast is buffet or set menu. You can have set menu in room. We would expect more from the buffet but we are happy to know that we could ask for eggs in different ways, bacon and yoghurt. Hope that will be part of the buffet in future so the guest do not need to ask for it every day. The fitness room is ok but miss more equipment. Like manuals/free weights. There is a outdoor gym just 50 m from the hotel that you can pay extra for(not belonging to the hotel, 700bath for 2 weeks). Last but not least we hope for a room upgrade some time during stay since we decided to stay her for 26 nights. Would be appreciated. We are happy so far and would recommend staying here.    Part two- after 4 weeks.  As a long stay guest I‚Äôm sorry to say your hotel still have enough to work on. Your staff is still working hard and do their best to be service minded. That we appreciate! After 4weeks stay we expect abit more from the management of the hotel. It‚Äôs normal to do some changes to the breakfast that is offered not to get too bored of the food for long time stay. Also a offer of upgrade of the room would be appreciated and/or at least a offer of late check out last day without charge (we declined the offer of 500bath for extra 4hours), would have cost nothing for the hotel to offer long stay guest. What about a fruit surprise in the room or something to say that we appreciate that we decided to stay longer than what is usual? Anyway we still would recommend short term stay and perhaps we would stay again for a week or so but sorry no longer. By the way, our room were booked with balcony. I recommend you write French balcony as it is not space for a chair. Thanks anyway. We stayed at this new hotel during about 2 weeks and it was great. The staff ia polite, helpful, always smiling and ready to help. Every time you return to the hotel you fell like the dearest friend, not just an ordinary hotel guest.  The location is great, about 10 min by foot to the beach, 1 min to the nearest 7-eleven shop, 3 min to the market, where you can buy fruits, vegetables during the entire day and also eat some tasty food after 6 p.m.  The room is spacious. Since the hotel is new, everything works great. We enjoyed also the view from the room (we wee on 7 floor) to the sea and the main road, from the big window (from floor to ceiling). The air conditioner works good and is also equipped witn antibacterial filter. The cleaning is carried out daily. Beach towels are also provided daily.  The breakfast is delicious. We also visited the restaurant of the hotel for dinner and lunch, it as great. The prices are moderate, the food is delicions ad the service is nice.  The swimming pool is located on the room, it is good for relaxig swimming. There are enough sunbeds, chairs and tables in the swimming pool area.    We recommend the hotel for everybody, looking for relaxing holiday in Pattaya. Good hotel. Didn‚Äôt try restaurant except for breakfast which was just ok. Underground parking. Clean pool but small, good for kids. Beach is a couple of blocks away, short walk  New and clean. Staff was nice and helpful Its pretty good to stay here for a holiday, the room very clean and big, yes it's new hotel, every thing work well and the staff always helpful,    Location : in the Jomtien road just a few min walk to the beach, front of the hotel there is a night market with fresh and cheap food also there is a bar beer in case of you just want to grab some drink.    Overal l : Sure recommended to stay here and i will probably come back agian. Great Location, Nice Room, Good staff. This is a fairly new hotel, and everything was working, clean and in order. A fantastic nice and quite roof pool where we spent many days. The personell was very kind and helpful and did utmost to make our stay as pleasant as possible. I only used the restaurant of this new hotel, called the Seafood restaurant. I live nearby when in Thailand and thought I would pop in. We were the only customers at the time of 4pm. A clean and smart enough place - probably used mainly by it's customers staying at the hotel. The prices are pretty reasonable. I had Spaghetti cabanora and my friend a Thai dish which I cannot recall the name of. We each had a glass of the white house wine (110 Bhts each). The one Thai waiter was very pleasant and very chatty with my Thai friend - I think the waiter was pleased to have someone to converse with - good luck to him.    It is unlikely anyone would just 'drop in' to this place as it is somewhat off the beaten track - basically a stiff 5 minute walk down to the sea and its plethora of eateries. But having said that we enjoyes ourselves.    Total price 577.80 Bhts which included VAT 7%. Although it said on the menu a service charge would be made of 7% that was not the case. We left our own tip. Stayed here for 5 nights, chosen mainly for its proximity to the beach and the entertainment centres. The hotel is relatively new so is still shiny and everything works. The rate for low season was good and included 2 breakfasts daily. The choice of breakfast was above average and the chef made a point of asking us every morning if he could rustle up something not on the buffet such as noodles, fried rice or omelettes.    Free hint: The hotel has many coaches of Chinese tourists so if you don't want to fight for the buffet wait till later as they all got up and left very early to take todays photographs.    Excellent infinity swimming pool on the roof but with no staffing, towels or a bar we didn't use it much.    It was a very short walk to many, many bars and restaurants, and despite being across from the bar complex at Rompho Market, was quiet at nights. There is also an excellent street food market just around the corner. I would definitely re book this hotel on any return trip to Jomtien. The LawinTa Hotel is simply superb.

23,MARKLAND SEASIDE PATTAYA - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Thailand),"Maid told lies about how many bottles of water .We are not stuck for a bottle of water but do not like liers .Also they charge us for something we never had it is wrong to do this and if this person lie about a bottle of water what eles can they lie about .??????? Lifts didn‚Äôt work properly. Had buffet for one day then it vanished had jam on toast for the remainder. If you wanted egg you had to go outside the restaurant (outdoors) to order it yourself no idea why. Delighted , Highly Recommended, Friendly Staff, Spacious and Clean Room, Reasonable sea view from the balcony, On the Beach, Noise free location, All amenities like Super market, Pharmacy, street food etc very good value for the money. location is excellent as it is within the beach area. spacious room and really good terrace. Furnitures are a little bit old, but still good and useful. I would gladly recommend this to friends I have stayed here before and the rooms are big but they are very dated,does need a facelift,the shower has a good built in area even though the shower itself does not have enough pressure but overall it‚Äôs value for money 1.They give me wrong information about breakfast time and I didn't get breakfast they don't help to solve problem.  2. I forgot something at bathroom of my room but it is lose when i called to ask about its. Huge bedroom in condo with nice view! Clean and quiet. We stay only one night but we enjoy the room which gave us an unforgettable memory in Pattaya.    Highly suggest for economic trip visitor if you would like to have a stay with gorgeous view of sea. This is a huge 27th Storied building. We stayed at 1126 and 726. Huge rooms and clean and side sea view and thats where it diviates form the picture given in booking.com. otherwife nice place with all facilities.  Everything is available within the complex and somany Indian Restaurants nearby. Nice locations. Some local attractions are very nearby.  Best size room in Pattaya. Only drawback that a mirror is inside bathroom and no mirrors inside room.  Highly recommended for families for long stay Huge room and great balcony view. However all the cupboards in the room as well as the bathroom smelt worse than the sewers, the aircon didn't work just the fan function, and the breakfast wasn't worth getting up for. The pool was fantastic but as mentioned by another reviewer, it is heavily monitored by the resident pool nazis. Definately can get better value for your money in Pattaya. Unfortunately my preferred hotel was closed for renovations. I were in hotel for one week, staffs are very friendly , the room is big but it should be renewed , we had amazing vacation in this hotel with beautiful sea view, also pool is great, location is very good . Thanks mark land close to the beach,big rooms and balcony,nice pool and a small gym,good breakfast are the best features of this place.  7 to 10th floor are used for tourists and the upper floors are rented as condo for a long stay.  BIG C shopping mall and body massage just 6 min and a small super market down the hotel. there are safety boxes in the reception free of charge.  do not forget to put the drinks in a safe place or u may be charged.  good staff and clean rooms but some rooms need painting and need design chane in the toilets Good spacious rooms with very nice balcony with magnificent beach view of pattaya. Wi-Fi available at rooms. Buffet breakfast (American style) with little vegetarian options. Better to depend on fruits, juices n salads if you are pure veggie. However lot of Indian restaurants nearby with good north indian n South Indian food options. My Accommodation was lovely because of every single one of the hotel's staff, of course the room was nice, big and clean, but it's nothing if you compare it to the smile of the staff in the morning, and there deep concern about our needs.    When it comes to this, maybe I should be clear, I was staying in room number 211 in the second floor and the rest of my college who were in the same floor, agreed about the staff in the hotel, specially ""Ahmed Moherat"".    Every day he was making my day with a very simple Gesture like the way he Folds my clothes in an artistic way,He kept my room clean and tidy for two weeks.    ""Ranen kamal"" The beautiful girl in the restaurant who is always smiling, and everyone in there ""Mohammed Katawy, Ayman Kabsis, Baker El-Mo‚Äômeny, Zayed El-salag, Aly Hadeer, Nader Abu-Alyamn, Malek El-Ebady, Eyad Kezlan,Amer Ghonem, Mohammed Salama and Mohammed Shareeda "" I hope I didn't forget anyone, every single one of the staff were friendly, professional and lovely.  In behave of all my colleagues, the people in the hotel where our family for two weeks, we loved them and we will miss them so much.    They'll be a great addition wherever they work! We have stayed in this hotel last week. This ia big building of 26 floors but rooms are only from 7th to 10th floor. The only good thing in this hotel is the Sea view rooms and also the location which is near to beach for water sports etc. The rooms are in bed condition and need major renovation. Furniture is old mattress are not of good sleep quality. Bathrooms also need a major changes and modern amenities. For each and anything you need to call reception. Strange part is that in pattaya kind of place where you go to beach they wont allow you a second towel in your room and will ask money for that.    The corridor is very wide but need a overhaul renovation to make it good. The pool was good but no life guard there.    Breakfast was below average for the vegetarians and if salad, fruit, corn flacks not there you cant survive. you get at least 8-10 items but all with meat or fish or like that. When you have so many indian tourists coming then why cant they keep at least one veg item    wifi connectivity was very bad in rooms and they dont even have a adapter to use 3 pin top in their 2 pic socket.    in this same budget you can get better rooms in that area and if they renovate it will benefit to them The rooms in this hotel are located on the 7 - 10 floors of a 26 storey residence condominum.Besides the nice views of the sea from the balcony of the room plus its location near to the main beach road there are no other ""pluses"".The rooms are run down and in urgent need for a major renovation..The furniture is old and the pillows are stained.Cleanliness in the room especially in the bathroom leaves much to be desired.For the price paid for the room,you can get better quality rooms elsewhere in Pattaya. Great location overlooking the bay if you lucky to get a room with a sea view. the hotel itself looks a bit like the owners lost interest in it years ago. needs new carpets badly. from the balcony the view is breathtaking, if only you could sleep on the balcony. the bedroom left a lot to be desired, we had asked to be moved from a room they initially gave us, that had a stench of cigarette smoke, but the new room was not all that great either.    One plus was it was cheap and the location was where we needed to be, easy access to taxi and shopping and close to the night market. probably wouldn't return. I stayed at The Mark Land Boutique Hotel from March 17th to 20th, 2017 with two of my sisters. We booked a suite with sea view. On arrival, room 723 was allotted to us which had its wooden flooring broken and in places it was caving in. We immediately asked for a change in a similar room in upper floors. We were told no other suite room is available. When I made booking 2 months earlier - why not a better room would have been reserved for me - the receptionist has no answer for it? With some bit of argument - we were given an identical suite room right opposite 723 and the flooring and condition of this room was perfectly fine! Then why this room (no. 726) was not given to us in the first instance?? Does the management think it's ok to take the Indian travelers for granted??    The newly allotted room - 726 was fine - large rooms with lot of natural light. The view from the balcony was nice. Beds were comfortable. But the room has become dated and needs a complete overhaul. The corridor is shabby and so is the service. The house keeping lady leaves the trolley right at the middle of the lobby. I also had a feeling that in the entire 7th floor we three ladies were the only occupants. There were plenty of Europeans staying in the hotel and they were all given accommodation at the upper floors. We, overall, had the feeling of being discriminated at.    We did not try the hotel restaurant. Breakfast was quite average.    One or probably only positive is the location - close to beach road and close to Tiffany and Alcazer shows. But it is far from the Walking Street.    Will I recommend the hotel to others? NO - you can find a better hotel and better hospitality in the similar price range. The hotel has amazing views from the rooms. I've been twice in Pattaya and each time the unbelievable picture from the balcony attracted me to stay at Mark Land. Rooms are very good, clean and the staff is professional. The breakfast is a buffet so anyone can find something nice to eat. I have been coming to this hotel every time I come to Pattaya. It is not even about sex tourism as I come with my wife and my friends. I know Pattaya has a bad name for some people, but there is soo many things to see around.  The hotel: The staff is as always amazing and specially the Manager. The breakfast used to be served on the roof top but now had moved below which is still great and more varieties of food. Rooms are great as I was upgraded which a treat.  The hairdresser next to the hotel is excellent. Make sure to have a visit as the lady is really nice. All in all the hotel is perfectly located from all the hustle and bustle but can be easily be accessed via a simple songthaew ride. The beach is right in front of the hotel so all you need is right there.  I would never hesitate to book anything else as this property is a great place.  Thank you Mark land hotels for giving us great moments. Location of this hotel is great. you can find taxi easily.If your room is sea view with a balcony the view from the room is amazing. I loved the breakfast in this hotel because you can enjoy your breakfast on top floor as a restaurant.  But I didnt like the enterance door of this hotel and also the lobby. lobby was so large but there were just 2 or 3 furniture for many people. We stayed her on New Years Eve!A very nice hotel perfectly located on the beach road!  Spacious rooms with a magnificant view of the fireworks.  The reception personell could have been more service minded.  But all in all, a nice place to stay. Location of the hotel is nice. You get taxis easily from dounside. The view from the rooms are super amazing. With the sea view rooms. The rooms are all above floors which has good view, the breakfast is one of the best things i liked about this hotel. And it has the top floor as a restaurant, from where the whole of pattaya city could be seen. Every things in this hotel is very bad except location.  The lobby and restaurant are very hot and no air conditioning.  This hotel is full of beetle and the staff were just a spray insecticides and they do not care.  Breakfast was very low and poor food and little international. A nice hotel with fantanstic beach view on the main pattaya beach road near by Family mart shop  giving nice breakfast on the top most floor we can have breakfast with nice beach views,  and good swimming pool on the 3rd floor. This is the Mark Land Boutique Hotel in North Pattaya that has its front entrance off a side road from Beach Road. All rooms have a sea view which is very refreshing and one of the features that makes this a value for money purchase. Deals are available from the front desk and it would be worth bartering when enquiring online. During my stay, the hotel did not appear to busy although a number of the floors are occupied by condos, owned mainly by relocated expats.    The room I stayed in was a good size and looked as if it had also originally been intended as a condo purchase, as suggested by a small kitchenette area that included a sink and non functioning hobs. There was also plenty of cupboard space.    The staff was very friendly and helpful, particularly in the restaurant and Tik at reception. Breakfast is included and provides a good range of western and Thai alternatives.    In the room itself the reception on the TV could have been better on certain channels and too many of the movie channels were tuned in for Thai language and not English, as in most Pattaya hotels. The room safe did not function so one at reception was available. Tea and coffee making facilities were available.    In general, the rooms were clean although on the odd occasion (over a 20 day stay) my room could have been cleaned more thoroughly.    A two minute walk from reception to Beach Road avails one of a plethora of taxis and baht buses, heading to Central and South Pattaya. So on the way to Walking Street transport will pass The Hard Rock Cafe, Central Festival Shopping Centre and Mike Mall to name but a few of popular tourist attractions in the area.    Although there may be more salubrious hotels in North Pattaya, they are also more expensive. The Mark Land Boutique Hotel does provide a quiet, decent and value for money option. This hotel is at very good location in Pattaya beach road, as all boats for coral island or Koh larn leaves just from the front of the hotel, all rooms are sea view rooms, Best room category is a Grand suite good for two people, as it is a two bed room suite, if you want to share the beds or couples, it can easily accommodate for 4,This one building have three hotels inside all by Markland name- 1. Markland Boutique, 2, Markland beach view, and Markland condominium all are good, but top floors with Markland condminium, Middle is with Markland beach view and Lower floors with Markland boutique., Old styled spacious rooms, the most spacious rooms in all hotels in Pattaya i have traveled till time, i stayed two days.though building is little old,this hotel has good front line sea view.worth the money.all shows shoppings restaurants are closeby.their restaurant is on roof,it has splendid view of all around city. This hotel was booked by my travel agent and I was in for a great surprise when I found that it is located right in front of the beach! Not only that, it is quite the prime area too. Quite a variety of shopping places and restaurants around too. The service was pretty okish... The 2:00 PM check-in time is a bit harsh I would say, especially when most Indians would arrive as early as 3 AM to Bangkok and by 6 AM to Pattaya. We had to wait in the lobby for about 6 hours and finally got an early check in option... The restaurant has limited variety in their breakfast menu, but the view from your table would be breathtaking, that you'd forget about what goes inside to your stomach :P The rooms were good and were maintained well. I would probably stay at the same hotel if at all I come back for another holiday out there :) Unfortunately the staff are all unfriendly, no toilet paper, had to keep Asking for it. Rooms are clean however a bit of bleach would not go astray. The pool is self serve, no pool bar or pool boy to help with the sun lounges, the stench in the pool/ gym area is unbelievable, dont get me wrong we have stayed in varies places in pattaya in the last 10 years and this really takes the cake. Make sure you bring your own pool towels as none are supplied you get yelled at there by the German residents as they think they own the pool, best to just go across the road to the beach. The noise is totally unbearable with other guests in the hotel they have no consideration for others at all hours of the night, with their paid companions arguing over monies due, on two occasions we had to ask them to please be quiet. The hotel it self is in a very good position, however very old and rundown. For the money there are far better hotels in Pattaya. The breakfast on the 27th floor is very poor, no air conditioning in the whole building only in your room. Overall poor value for money. Would not recommend. I stayed in a private apartment so I can only review the areas which are common to the private condos and the hotel:  + a good location close to the beach, bars and restaurants  + The view from the upper floors is spectacular  + There is a restaurant on top of the building serving both Thai and western food ‚Äì I found it amazing that the ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù breakfast didn‚Äôt have bacon.  + The pool was attractive and because of the climate, generally warm  + Generally very quiet  + Street food is very close, very cheap and very good  - The staff in the Lobby were incredibly rude and unhelpful ‚Äì they would not even exchange a 100 baht bill for smaller bills for use on a baht bus - the money was right there in a drawer. Other staff at the pool and the security area were friendly and polite.  - The gym was a joke, more than half the equipment was broken or not fit for purpose. Just a tick in the box. If you are from that type of person who care about staff behavior I will strongly recommend you that never go to this hotel . Besides the rooms are terribly messy and I found cockroach there for more than 2 or 3 times .The only positive thing in this hotel is its view from restaurant and pool . We stayed in this hotel because of its location on the beach at the quieter North end of the seafront. I got my desired sea view from a spacious balcony. This hotel is on floors 7-10 in a 27 storey block of Condos - if fails to be either a hotel or condo. We stayed in a suite room for 2500 baht a night and it was a huge clean room, much more like a studio room with 2 huge beds and plenty of space with a kitchen area. Breakfast on the 27 floor holds a stunning view well worth a visit even if you are not staying in the hotel. The service however lets this hotel down, for some reason you get no toilet paper in the room and on questioning the lady boy at reception you get a very poor couldn‚Äôt care less attitude. During our stay it was full of travellers from the Indian continent that might go some way to explaining the service and treatment at reception.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.946652,100.885010&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.946652,100.885010&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.946860,100.884850|12.945836,100.889351|12.947358,100.889198|12.945370,100.887077|12.946270,100.886261&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.945942,100.888512|12.945222,100.886719|12.945535,100.885284|12.945942,100.888336|12.947791,100.885063|12.945237,100.886757|12.947760,100.884895|12.945852,100.888542|12.947489,100.884918&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.945731,100.888847|12.947556,100.885757|12.948326,100.885590|12.950534,100.885422|12.945615,100.885139|12.944045,100.887093|12.944705,100.888603&signature=E8iDt-osN8_Oe0fJbhV7xDk23r8=",1.0,Positive
24,"NEW NORDIC MARCUS - Prices & Condominium Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","Nobody speaks english.  Rooms are very good, clean and lots of swimming pools, fitness center ( very small) good restaurant.  The beaches are awful.  Breakfast is teach but personally I don‚Äôt understand rice chicken and onions in the morning, coffee is disgusting.  Nice facility but the area is pretty pour and smelly... Stayed at New nordic Kristin a couple of years ago and room was fine but had to use Marcus for breakfast and pool. So decided to stay in New nordic again and was put in the Marcus. I haven't seen one member of staff smile (except guy checking us in) with the building needing refurbishment. The bright orange in some places are dull, the sink in the room is cracked, the roof on one of the buildings is all flakey. The roof top pool has edge tiles missing whereby I nearly cut myself. Currently they are clearing out the main pool (had event so was boarded) with the worker drilling the metal pipes on the water with electric drill and plug socket on his body. One slip and that's it. New nordic are vastly expanding but they need to maintain what they have. Not impressed compared to last stay. Uncertain if I would choose again. Dust and rust in pool. Got a suspicion that they will not be draining but put cleaning solution in - yuk!!!!! We arrive to pattaya full good intention we stayed at new nordic kristine very nice place nice room clean a bit far from centre but ok for what we paid only problem no hot water in the morning and also in the late evening . We wanted to rent a motorbike and book some excursion for the next days so from the new nordic kristine where people was friendly they sent us to the new nordic marcus tourist information ! We where welcome from a girl that didn't work there asking us to wait ! Then the girl working at the information desk arrive and strait away you could see the rude attitude she had! We where shocked on the way she was talking to us like we where stupid and she expect from us to know how the tour work but of course was hour second day in pattaya(so we didn't know nothing about it) and then is her job to explain and give us information !but she was to busy taking sweet's from her bags !i was so nervous that i needed to live and she was laughing behind !! I will not recommended to anyone!! Ps: all the stuff in the nordic kristine was nice and very friendly they should deal whit customers Small and friendly with everything you need, including an excellent restaurant. Good location and with resonable prices. Very relaxing pool and roof bar on top floor. Breakfast ala carte all day, comfortable beds and ok wifi connection. Many facilities including massage and home bakery.Helpful and skilled staff in the reception. Just like last year we finished our Asia trip in Pattaya and without any hestitation we decided to stay in the New Nordic Village in Hotel Marcus. Centrally located between Pattaya and Jomtien and close to Jomtien Beach this Orange New Nordic Village offers you very spacious and luxurious rooms, friendly staff, affordable massages (same prices as in Pattaya!!) a nice menu with great Thai AND Western Food. Various swimming Pools and this year we enjoyed a music week with live music every night! So absolutely value for money. I would recommend this hotel without a doubt! We stayed here a few months ago. Standard of food was good, staff were friendly and helpful and rooms were clean. For the price we cannot recommend it enough. Walking distance to the beach and good bars and restaurants nearby. Its also away from the madness of Pattaya if you prefer a quieter location. We would definitely stay here again. Nice comfortable hotel good foods and frech comfortable rooms I must say the staff is extremely friendly and helpful you don't find that somewhere els also nice management the treat you like a family nothing is to much I'm glad I'm there new customer and for sure I will be back Great hotel. Really cheap prizes and a sweet and helpful staff :-)  I went there in low season, so I only paid half prize for a very nice hotel room with lots of room :-) Breakfast was included, and that too was vet nice and tasty. Nice clean hotel with two swimming pools,restaurant,loved everything about it just about 20 mins walk away from walking street. a small beach 5 mins walk away, they do charge 1000 bhat deposit on check in.few bars and restaurants right outside the hotel.Free wifi We have been in for 3 days in this hotel.Staff are ok,room excellent,the only issue is the breakfast.Nothing to do with European,no croissant or similar in this buffet,also no customer service from the waitresses,they clear your table even of you are still eating.....not very good If you want a clean and relatively new place to stay, hotel Marcus is an allright deal : value for Money. Roughly 2300 bath incl. Breakfast for standard room, is a fair price. 10 minutes walk to the beach and approx. the same time by cab to Pattaya center.  5 stars in their logo outside the hotel, have nothing to do with reality, and can therefor only be looked at the same way, a 7 star greek Metaxa brandy, is standing in comparance with cognac :-).    New Nordic group is expanding, and there is some construction work going on in the area. They are offering another room in their complex, if the noise is bothering, but since construction is going on in all directions, that does'nd really help. The staff is mostly very friendly, but seems to be poorly trained. We experienced, and observed several unnessercary episodes, leading to annoyed guests. Especialy the breakfast was not up to standard, so that we and some other guests decidet to drop breakfast at the hotel, and rather bought one further down the street, at a local place.  Once construction is completed, and with a better trained staff, combined with a gueranteed breakfast standard, the satisfaction score could easely reach 4-5 , but for now, 3 is generous enough. I have stayed here several times as I have property here to I have to say the standard has gone down there are no sunbeds by the pool the bar area seating in pew bar is always taken by staff and sales guys all day where they should be left for guest they have lost touch with the clients more interested in selling property than actually dealing with client needs also the wifi in the hotel is very poor not ideal for business users I have my holidays 2 weeks in Thailand with my husband then we chose New nordic hotels concept Marcus because the price is reasonable more than others when we arrived we felt this is nicest hotel that we have ever stayed in Pattaya. I like the facility in the hotel.The swimming pool was good. We also had the dinner in the restaurant in the hotel I love the steak the test was unique. I don't have any negative of this hotel or staff. A wonderful way to finish off our holiday, I just wish we had booked for longer Nobody speaks english.

A wonderful way to finish off our holiday, I just wish we had booked for longer","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.915245,100.862549&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.915245,100.862549&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.914870,100.868263|12.924710,100.867577|12.920770,100.866524|12.923032,100.868019|12.921944,100.866280|12.909230,100.858452|12.919580,100.867058|12.924372,100.868126|12.916930,100.866753&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.913368,100.873314|12.923379,100.859665|12.911025,100.860687|12.922490,100.859955|12.924771,100.860611|12.910872,100.861397|12.923467,100.859528|12.915442,100.857048|12.913666,100.870483&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.922674,100.859497|12.924386,100.859207|12.911690,100.871002|12.923552,100.859947|12.910459,100.868332|12.923232,100.859421|12.925546,100.861938|12.913719,100.867088|12.923741,100.869438&signature=uRzG9kuqkgRoUxi-p_lRSUiDSfw=",0.9999,Positive
25,OAKWOOD HOTEL JOURNEYHUB PATTAYA - Updated 2022 Prices & Reviews (Thailand),"How it can get 5 stars blows my mind, unless they rate themself, I was staying there in 2020 and went home just as Covid started, not the best stey I have had in Pattaya, by far. Very noisy, when I left I forgot my hoodie in the reception, and they e-mailed me to contact them, called them and they would put it to the side, now it's finally possible to come back, and guess what, no hoodie they can't find it, and the excuse is that the manager is not working there anymore, so they can't do anything about it. I very much enjoyed my stay at the oakwood hotel. The room was modern and very well looked after. All the staff were amazing and extremely helpful. They spoke good English and were helpful in every way. Easy walking distance to bars and restaurants. I will stay here again, and would highly recommend it to friends. Location: good, but need to have a car for going everywhere  Room: Nice, spatious and comfortable.  Staff: Very friendly and helpful. Even friendly for pets. Good for customers with pet.  Place: Okay. Pool too small and not as beautiful as in the picture. Pet friendly but without any garden for pets. Parking seemed hard. Not much of parking lots.  Breakfast: terrible. Do bot book with breakfast!?!. Go find something to eat elsewhere. Trust me Had a great two weeks stay during May 2021 in the center of Pattaya. Everything is easy to reach by walk once you get to know the area. Food and nightlife nearby. The rooms are specious and cleaned daily. The staff is very supportive and friendly, also open for any special request. I definitely will consider the hotel again during my next stay in Pattaya. Excellent hotel , room is clean and comfortable. Friendly staffs and helpful. location is good , near Pattaya beach , attractions places, convenience store. Easy to travel. I did not try breakfast because I have plan to go to have break fast another place I only stay for one night as a single women, i feel safe and secure to stay on my own. Good location, clean and quiet room. I would like to thank you Mr. Kaustubh Sur - General Manager, Mr. Wethin and team for excellent service. I will visit them again soon. I stayed two times in this hotel, I like the rooms very clean and modern. The most important I can bring my cat, pets are allowed, the staff is very friendly. Many restaurant and bars in this area you can walk. Je recommande cet endroit pour tous, tr√®s bien situ√© et calme. I checked in 3 November and stayed until 14 December. I had an exceptionally difficult time finding a loNG term home. Moving to Pattaya with a pet, proved to unusually complicated. The staff were quite understanding and accommodating; even accepting my parcels. I was welcomed warmly, and treated like a VIP guest. 10/10 Highly recommend. A very nice place with excellent service and host.  The decor is good and the place is spotless.  Location is what it is on second Road so no decent views.  Extremely comfy bed and all the room facilities worked to the highest order.  A couple of niggles: the loo is far too close to the shower screen making it very difficult to use, there is no balcony furniture which is very poor and there isn't a clothes drying rack.  Overall bearing in mind the price I can find better. We had a nice stay at Oakwood. The GM welcomed us and was a very good host during our stay. The beds were very comfortable.    Interior Design 7  Service 10  Facilities 8  Cleaning 9  Sound-proofing 10  Location 8  Comfortable Beds 10  Breakfast 8    Average Rating = 8.75 / 10 We needed an affordable place to stay for the weekend that was near the pier since we were going to be finishing our PADI certification. After searching, and finding several places were still closed, we found the website for Oakwood Hotel. We booked online.    First, this isn't a hotel with a beach view. If that is what you're looking for, you will be disappointed. However, if you are looking for a quiet, friendly, clean, and comfortable place to stay, away from the noise of the walking street, but close enough to it for a visit, this is where you should stay. There are several Thai restaurants in short walking distance, a shopping area that connects to one of the main streets, etc. for the evenings.    Every staff member was extremely kind and helpful as we checked in on Friday, went in and out on Saturday, and checked out on Sunday. They kept our luggage secure after check out so we could finish our final dives before returning to Bangkok Sunday night. The breakfast was outstanding with many choices (Thai and western), fresh vegetables, and eggs made to order. We did enough time in the water with Scuba gear, so we did not try the pool, but it was quite nice-looking. While we were there, the hotel is donating a large bag of rice for each guest to help those adversely affected by the pandemic. What a great idea!    This will be the place we stay on our next trip to Pattaya. This hotel has surpassed expectations through exceptional customer service and the accommodation of some special requests. The hotel is central to everything in Pattaya, easy to walk to many restaurants and bars, as well as the beach. The rooms are comfortable, and the beds are fantastic. They have a decent breakfast buffet and a gym and library. The rooftop pool is also quite beautiful. The price is nice as well. We will certainly be back. Thanks for a great stay, especially to the kind manager, Ritwik. We like Oakwood Hotel. The hotel is very clean. Pillows and linens are new and immaculate. A quiet and calm hotel. A place where you can stay with your family. Thankyou Mr. Jo. He realized the wrong reservation we made and corrected it. We found the comfortable, safe and quiet hotel in pattaya. I can say that room was very new, clean and wide space. lovely staffs, the rooftop has swimming pool with nice view otherwise it look small but we can relaxed without any annoying. stayed for a week but feel good every day before I going out put the key at reception and talk a little bit with staff. love their smile love their treat us. for sure that I will come back again and again Hotel located at the central of central Pattaya. very near to go to the shopping mall and not to far for go to beach. like the aecurity gaurd who stand in front of lobby door. staff always smile and greeting say sawasdee with rise thier hands to wai Recent stayed for a couple days. everything was good I love the pool at the roof top next to restaurant. spent the time whole day at the pool. great location just behind the mall. staff so friendly room very good to sleep We had an amazing stay at this hotel. The staff were fantastic and the room was extremely comfortable. Will be staying here in the future and I believe that Oakwood will be my hotel of choice in the future. Good location, nice rooms, very clean and friendly and helpful staff. Highly recommended for short and long stay. Very close to second and beach road, shopping malls and night life with free shuttle service to Shopping mall Terminal 21. The hotel is good nice location and huge room,Staff at reception are friendly,Nan and boy are we good staff.And room is perfect i like all,I will come back soon and recommend my friends to stay here. ^^ I stayed here for three days every day I walk pass the lobby staff always smile and greeting me with say sawadee breakfast is very good there are Indian and Thai chef here. It is very warm and enjoyed my stay Very nice everything here  I enjoy my stay friendly staff. Hotel is located at central Pattaya. very easy to go every where I like all of here staff, restaurant swimming pool I suppose to come back here again in the future. We stayed there for four nights.It is a wonderful hotel with walking distance to beach side . They provide free wifi and free shuttle service to Terminal 21 . Staff was courteous and helpful from the start especially Mr.Arijit, manager of hotel. Stay was really comfortable. Would highly recommend this hotel.Lastly thanks to Mr.Akash ,owner of the restaurant for arranging all our trips. We stayed here in dec 2019 during our trip to pattaya.The location of good is ok 10 minutes walk to the beach and 2 min away from mall.The cleanlines is not upto the mark.The balcony was not very clean,very dim lights in the room and corridors.Although we had extended our stay our room excess was not extended,had to ask the staff to do so.We requested for extra doormats the lady staff told that they can only give it after room cleaning.  But would say the rooftop restaurant was good with the restaurant owner Mr Akshay being very kind and takes utmost care in serving tasty food.His morning Tea always made our day in Pattaya.Thank you Akshay.Also would like to mention restaurant staff Miss Nancy very humble and courteous. We Stayed at this hotel along with our 7months old Infant, this hotel is a true bliss for tourists in pattaya. Best part is the location and the food, the hotel is situated in the centre tourist location and at a walkable distance to the beach, the restaurant serves an yummy breakfast menu and they also did alter and provided us the food with our taste and choice for dinner....initially before booking our hotel, we were little worried as we had our baby travelling with us...but this hotel made our stay really comfortable and memorable with their hospitality.... This hotel is managed very professionally and with lot of warmth. Hospitality was at its best. Will recommend any one who's visiting Pattaya. They have a very good team who helps you a lot. A special mention to Mr. Arijitt the Manger who takes atthi devo bhava saying seriously and treats guests as gods. A very comfortable stay. He even helped us with lot of local things to do. They have one of the very good Indian restaurants which serves best biryani as well along with proper menu. They even made dishes as per our request. A special mention to the restaurant owner Mr akshay. Overall enjoyed our experience here. We were a group of 3 travellers from India and after a lot of research ended up booking at Oakwood Hotel, Pattaya. After checking-in, we realized that this was a great choice of stay at Pattaya. Hotel situated right behind Pattaya Avenue mall is the biggest advantage as it's walk-able to the beach and to the Walking Street. The rooms are cozy, clean and the housekeeping service is on their toes to make sure your stay is spent well without any hassles. The best part is that Arijit (GM - Oakwood) frequents the hotel and personally checks for the guest's experience and his suggestions on Clubs, Restaurants and other places never let us down. If you are looking for a great experience in PATTAYA, it has to be Oakwood!!! I visited the hotel in Dec with couple of my friends. What struck a chord with us immediately was the warm welcome we were given by Usa & team. We were upgraded to the suite rooms. We requested couple of things in the room & the front desk worked immediately to have those fixed in 5 mins!!! The rooms look 5 star & well appointed.    Our trip was made complete by the warm hospitality extended to us by the GM of the property Mr Arijit Ghosh. He went out of his way to ensure we feel welcomed. All the suggestions he gave us on food & places to explore were right on the money. We bumped into him outside as well & he was kind enough to get us VIP treatment in one of the clubs. Never have I experienced this personal touch considering I travel a lot for work & stay in best properties around the world.    The restaurant upstairs serves good food & restaurant manager was very friendly to us. He prepared the dishes fresh for us & it was great breakfast.    Last but not the least the staff at this hotel were always kind to my friends & I. We never got NO for an answer & they ensured they gave us 7 star service in the midst of all the chaos of big tour groups they had to support as well!!! Anytime we in Pattaya this is the place to stay. We visited Pattaya last month and this place was awesome to stay. Right in the center of the city and have access to all the important sightseeing points. We recommend the hotel for everyone who visit Pattaya. Stay at the hotel was very comfortable & reasonably priced. Would highly recommend the pool bar & restaurant for relaxation and good food. There was choice of cuisine & good service by the staff. Looking forward for my next visit and stay. The food here is very tasty with excellent food quality. Was here with a group of friends,we all had a wonderful experience specially with the food.A very clean and tasty buffet.  Would definitely come back. This is a new hotel and things are very shiny and new. Everything works as it should and it was a very comfortable stay. I was most impressed with the reception staff as they were so lovely, being friendly, humorous, helpful and professional, amd they spoke and understood English very well. The staff really made my stay enjoyable and problem free. The hotel is located in a cul de sac with a good food court, shopping complex with cinema and assorted other shops near by. Thanks for everything üòÉ Before check in i was not sure about the quality of the property as there are very less reviews available. But once i checked in it was a wonderful experience. The GM of the property has personally look after all the arrangements which was a nice gesture from his part.Though the location of the property is not in the middle of the city its not very tough to locate it. Stayed there in second week of June with friends in the base category room (deluxe) for three days. It's a new hotel, and the rooms are nicely done. The cleanliness, not only in the rooms but also in all the areas are commendable. The beds are so comfortable that you will start feeling sleepy once you lay down on them.The hotel is just at the centre of the city but still undisturbed from the traffic and busyness of the city. Have a nice swimming pool at the roof top, and the restaurant is next to it. The restaurant serves international food with local flavours, and some Indian varieties too. The food quality is good and with good taste. The entire staffs are amazing, and are ready to assist anytime. The beach is about 150 meters if walked through the Avenue Mall in front of the hotel. Quite near to Central Festival shopping mall and Pattaya Night Bazar.  We enjoyed staying at this hotel and would definitely try it again. Will surely recommend to friends and family. Keep up the good work. We were looking for a safe and comfortable property for our family and yet in downtown pattaya. Oakwood provided us the same with brand e  New room ,amazing staff a d great food of our choice. They have rooftop swimming pool with nice and cozy atmosphere . The place is very centrally located to reach anywhere in town with tuktuk.its just behind avenue mall so easy excess . We had tried breakfast and Thai food and had great time . We will be back soon with friends to stay i    .","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.928206,100.881882&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.928206,100.881882&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.931667,100.879440|12.929736,100.877899|12.930410,100.879868|12.929733,100.877876|12.931495,100.879868|12.927390,100.883560|12.929448,100.881233|12.925632,100.883415|12.929153,100.878326&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.928125,100.881294&signature=keqYELyne3gH6L4sblUvKM0f9o0=",1.0,Positive
26,"PASADENA LODGE - Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","I have stayed here on my past 3 trips. The rooms are nice (especially the biggest ones) and you can't beat the location. I wish the prices were just a little bit lower, but the staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean and secure. It's still a good value and they will continue to get my business. The location is great. Just step outside the hotel and rent a bike and roam around pattaya. Absolutely central in Pattaya, close to all the night life and a bout 10 minutes walk to the beach. The customer service was exceptional. I stayed for 2 nights, room is clean, bed is comfy. Value for money, comfortable and quiet. Good food, staff are very friendly. Booked directly thru hotel this trip, $1000 baht a night cash price, high season,agoda wanted $58 aud per night, thru the hotel direct worked out to be $39 aud,worked out to be quite a saving over 24 night stay.First of all area is nightlife area so early to bed ,light sleepers won't get to much sleep ,personally didn't have any problems sleeping even on early nights in.I stayed in superior room on 3rd floor ,room cleaned well every day everything worked well tv, DVD player,good pressure in shower and hot water ,a/c no problems overall a good stay and recommend this hotel staff friendly and did there job well.Just to touch on a few gripes from previous reviews , the cleaning of the room works if you don't drop your key down at reception by 3 pm ( note on back of room door) they assume you don't want your room cleaned but fresh towels are available from reception also mini bar has been removed but 2 water supplied everyday agree with Brandon h review asi thought water was complentary but was charged on paid the bill but would be nice to have complentary water as most hotels do it management should rectify this or inform people at checkin as I said great hotel ,good staff ,clean hotel, Stayed here for 11 nights and really impressed with the size of the Superior Room. It had plenty of room for storage, Dining table and even a banana lounge. It had also been tastefully decorated. And the blackout curtains made it easy to sleep in.    I was so disappointed to to be charged for the two small bottles of water that was left in my fridge each day when I checked out.    I have been traveling to Thailand for 25 year and every hotel leaves you bottles of complimentary water each day. There was no price list anywhere in my room that indicated the water was not complimentary. And there was definitely not alcohol in the fridge that would indicated it was a mini bar.    And if you sleep in past 2pm ( which so many of us do when visiting Soi Metro) then don't expect to get your room cleaned Nice and clean hotel with with 3 different sizes of rooms, small,medium & large.If you are alone the small will do the work, for couples i recommend the medium one and the large one is more luxury or for families.The staff is nice and kind Thai people that always will take care of you.The French owner is a nice and always there for you.The hotel is in the middle of the LK Metro area with a lot's of English pubs and sport bars. The staff and the owner speak good English.The rooms don't have a mini bar but they have a refrigerator, so you can buy your own drinks and have them there A/C, Safe in room, clothing storage, TV & DVD player, full size shower, Kettle coffee & tea making facilities, Free Wi-Fi in room & the lounge with the occasional drop out std Wi-Fi for Thailand.The hotel is about +- 1,5 km from the beach . First please excuse very late,review stayed here for 21 nights in May/ June 2016 contacted hotel direct on there website when arrive had good specials on, for May June July decided to take deluxe room 1000 baht a night .all rooms had specials starting from 600 baht.Room was huge at front of building, on 3 floor no worries due to lift very handy for luggage to & from room, good walk in shower good pressure and for those people who use hot water in Thailand the water was hot.Room cleaned daily fresh towels etc , Internet worked well the whole time,hotel is guest friendly with no pesky joiner fees.Staff were friendly and cleaners do a good job with any early morning knock on doors etc they wait till u drop key at reception and if u haven't by 3 pm ur room will be cleaned next day which worked well for me.Lk metro area great place to stay plenty of options in area for food drink & plenty of fun. Stayed at the Pasadena Lodge for 11 nights from late May to early June...Awesome lodge...clean tidy rooms and cleaned daily, and 4 options of rooms..i stayed in the deluxe room with balcony...If your not out partying you can hear noise from bars below in the soi and might find it hard to sleep in these front rooms...i suggest a room out the back for some peace and quiet...i didn't have a problem with the noise as i was one of the people making it... Nice hotel located in great location to the Soi LK Metro entertainment area, my selection for room style was DELUXE room 2nd floor facing Soi LK clean well appointed rooms with fridge, A/C, Safe in room, clothing storage, TV & DVD player, full size shower with great water supply, Kettle/coffee making facilities, clean linen changed daily, Free Wi-Fi in room with the occasional drop out std Wi-Fi for Thailand lol, Balcony for smokers (no smoking in room) Room has a nice fresh smell unlike other hotels i have stayed before, Lift for those like me don't like stairs, entertainment noise from nearby venues can be a little loud for early or light sleepers, Joiner friendly, Found the room pricing fair I booked direct with hotel via email getting a prompt confirmation reply, no deposit required..... I paid once I was happy with room inspection. Found staff to be friendly and easy to communicate with std thai/english style of chat lol, Hotel does not offer any meals which is not a problem as there are numerous eating options within 100 metre radius. Happily stay here again..... recommend this hotel for those that do not require 5 star treatment or expect 5 star @ 3 star pricing ... give it a try Stayed here for ten nights every thing clean and in its place,elevator very handy for luggage etc as I was 4 th floor .Staff were friendly and did there jobs well rooms very clean and good size.location in lk metro great for nightlife great sports bar next door I rovers Gogobars and beer bars aplenty ,street vendors at night and plenty food options in the area.Hotel is guest friendly and don't charge joiner fees All up recommend this hotel to the single traveler who likes the nightlife. Great place Soi LK is a noisy place full of gogos and bars, and most places in the Soi are rooms above noisy all night bars    Pasadena is locared in the corner and is a nice modern place, the only drawback is the rooms are small. I've stayed here a number of times in the past five years. I keep going back because it is a decent hotel in a good location. It hasn't changed much, but has held up fairly well. It's located in the middle of a growing ""entertainment"" district, so if you're looking for ""fun"" this is a good base. My recent stay was with my family and there was no issues with having our young daughter with us. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.    Pros: Clean, good value, elevator, comfortable firm bed, quiet rooms in the back, nice lobby, parking, wifi good except at peak times. Cons: Needs some upgrades, old TV, no room to put things in the bathroom, uncomfortable chair in room.    My main gripe is the surly owner, He's an older who guy never says hello, smiles, or greets guests. I don't know what his problem is? Probably just been in Pattaya too long. I stayed here from 17-20 August 2013... I couldn't get my work done cause their wifi here seemed to work in day time but still very weak then in night time it completely down,, I'm not sure if it was down or they just turn of the wifi because they think they can save up!!    The bed was so hard like sleep on the floor .if you get used to sleep on pillow bed then you have to looking for new place.    i had superior room with balcony but i never opened my balcony cause not thing nice to see but the old building next to it, and the back side door was just a thin glass door and can break down very easily . if you have some value stuff u never want to leave them in your room.. so watch out when u stay here... but so far i never got lost anything here yet.. I like Pasadena Lodge. Stumbled upon it a few years back and been going back ever since. It has a nice splash of greenery around the entrance. Nice clean rooms of a good size. Rooms equipped with WiFi and DVD player. The Hotel is very well located, the rooms are okay and relatively clean - because of it's location it is a little b√≠t noisy, but still not as noisy as you would expect it in one of pattayas partyzones.    Anyway - unfortunately I got robbed by supposedly by one of the frontdeskmanagers. They are the only ones who have access to the keys for roomsafes. Originally I wanted to check out on a Saturday - but the I decided to stay longer, the next day I realized that money was missing. They took not all the money: 200 Euros, 200 Ringgit and 100 Singpore Dollars - any other thief would have taken all the money and my camera, my passport and my iPhone. And of course the thief would not have locked the safe again.    So I suppose that one of them, expecting me to check out on the next day, entered my room, opened the safe, took some of the money and though, that I would realize it only when i left already. The whole issue was very disappointing. I had the impression the only person who really cared about it and was upset, was the cleaning maid, who cleaned my room every day but had no access to the safekeys. The police did also not care very much - they offered me to write a paper for my insurance...wtf?!?    So, I can only recommend to go to another hotel - there are enough in pattaya and I am pretty sure, that at least some have honest staff. Not bad place, but main problem was terrible smell from  toilet. Like someone died in the ventilation.  I hope you like sleep with opened window :)  And air con works only in one fan and temperature mode. I just spent 10 nights at pasadena lodge pattaya.  Is it a hotel(no) is it a guesthouse (yes) Is it a lodge (yes). no food. no swimming pool. no smoking. no big tv..friendly staff especially thecleaning lady. Only stayed one night in this hotel while visiting friends visiting pattaya.    The hotel is small, very clean & tidy. The staff were truly wonderful & welcoming. I had a standard room as the hotel was almost fully booked & larger rooms were not available.    The room was very comfortable with a fully stocked fridge, The bed very comfortable. My only comment was the shower head holder was broken, not really a problem.    Next time I go to Pattaya, I will book the Pasadena for longer. Stayed for 16 nights in late August in Room 401' the Deluxe room@1300pn.    Nice room with balcony front. Good bed and nice bathroom, though not much room for toiletries. Old modelmTV with good cable, Aircon broke and was fixed in 2 hrs, but I did not feel the temp control was accurate. Nie big room and excellent staff. Front desk and cleaners were friendly and willing to help. Taxi back to BKkK was excellent quality clean and good driver.    If you like This side of 2nd road, want an intimate hotel with elevator and nice room, I would highly recommend Stayed here in May and enjoyed every moment here.    I usually stay in cheaper guesthouses, but decided to pay the 2-300 baht extra and give this hotel a try. I will always stay here when I'm in Pattaya now.    I tried two different rooms, a superior room and a deluxe room. Both were tastefully decorated, comfortable, very clean and safe. Had big TV's with satellite channels, a mini bar and great bathrooms. I don't have a preference between the two rooms as both were fantastic.    The staff were really cool, very helpful with great English and didn't seem to mind when I extended my booking a little as i was unorganized.    The noise was a minor issue, but that's expected anywhere on Soi LK Metro. If you like peace and quiet, maybe this isn't for you. But it didn't bother me at all.    LK Metro is my favourite soi in Pattaya as i don't like to venture on to walking street too much. It's more chilled out with some great bars and people around. I suspect more hotels like Pasadena will surface in the future. We offer 21 affordable luxury rooms, right in the center of Pattaya. Our hotel is surrounded by plenty of dine&entertain businesses and located at a walking distance from the sea and the famous Pattaya night life (walking street). Our Premises offer great style and confort with of courses all usual benefits (wifi, mini bar, parking, TV, DVD players, lift...Price range from 800 to 1500B  General information :  Hotel is located near Soi Buakhao and Pattaya Klang. Near by you will find plenty of dining and entertainnement spots, night markets, supermarkets, shopping arcade and other convenience stores...Public transportation or private taxi services are also available, however mostly of your daily needs are at a walking distance. The Pattaya beach is at 10 minutes walking distance This property was an unexpected find on LK Metro. It is in the corner of this very popular entertainment area, which makes it surprisingly quiet. This entertainment area tends to be more blue collar than Walking Street, and the prices reflect this. Nevertheless, the lobby is done as nicely as any high end hotel, and the recently refurbished rooms run from exceptional but small to quite roomy. The staff is quite friendly and funny. The bar is just for decoration at the moment, and there is no food. Very well stocked mini-bar. The in room safe is too small for a lap top. Free wifi. Large, well appointed bathroom, but it is a Thai toilet (do not flush paper products). A/C unit could be better. However, for about $3 more per night than the closets that pass for rooms elsewhere on the Soi, it rocks! I will stay again. Hope I can add photos later. I stayed here for 5 nights and the stay was quite pleasant. I booked the larger room which is 1,500 Bahts and it was a good size room and it was clean and comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly and did their best to help where they could. The location is quite good, it can be a little noisy at times but then most parts of Pattaya are pretty much the same. There are plenty of good places to eat and drink nearby. So even though there in no Breakfast etc at the hotel there are many options for that close by for around 100 Bahts or so.  I read on of the previous reviews where they said their room was burgled by someone coming in from the balcony. My balcony door had 2 locks and by locking both of these i never had any problems.  The rooms are non smoking but you can smoke on the balcony if required. This place is in a great location, after some initial booking hiccups my stay here was pleasant, although the 1200 baht a night room was a little expensive for what you get eg: no breakfast no deadbolt and a view of the green plastic flapping from the building next door and the thing that peeves me the most........ a queen bed made up of two single pushed together. The cheaper room a great bed.Next door the Irish Rover bar does a great breakfast and has very friendly owners and staff. I was in Pattaya for holiday last month and decided to stay in Pasadena Lodge so that I can get some sleep away from the noisy Walking Street. The hotel was generally very clean and the housekeeping did a great job. Front office staff was really pleasant and had gone out of the way to assist their guests.The hotel was surrounded by a very nice nightlife area where one can get almost anything one desire.    I would strongly recommend this hotel to anyone who like the fast-pace nightlife of Pattaya with an avenue to escape back to some peace and quite to sleep / rest. This hotel looks nice,but they don't accept debit or credit cards.There is no room service.  Unfortunately on my first night in the hotel my room was burgled as I slept,the culprit  having broke in through the locked balcony windows after tampering with the chain from  the outside.  There is construction going on next door which starts around 7am.  Also it is entirely non smoking,which in my experience is very unusual in Thailand.  The staff were very pleasant and apologetic,but I would not stay there again. Surprise, surprise, some strange dude walked in on me while I was lounging around in my boxer briefs.    Okay, okay, I am not sure I locked the door. He was using his key to open the door to his room down the hall. But the thing is, I am in the habit of using the deadbolt when I am in the room, and there wasn't one. So there's a safety concern.    Other than that, the room is okay. There's a big bed, but don't get excited, it's a pair of twin mattresses pushed together, so there's a ridge in the middle.    TV with local Pattaya cable channels. Refrigerator full of beers and soda that you can shuffle around make room for you own stuff. Closet space. But oddly, no hangers.    The bathroom is in an odd place, through a set of patio doors on the way to the window/veranda, as if the bathroom is the patio. There is a distinct lack of towel bars. Or hot water. And I guess it must be a city mandate that they use that blue stuff in the toilet bowl.    The veranda itself is not much to speak of. It's a narrow affair with room for a single chair. You have to step over the table to sit in the chair. It's not terribly well thought out. It overlooks another hotel's balcony and a narrow canyon of concrete, rooftops, spikes and barbed wire. It's not really a view to speak of, but at least there's sunlight.    Soi LK Metro, center of which this L-shaped street the hotel is located, is a street of go-go bars, pubs, golf-player hangouts and billiards places. So there's lots of loud music, shouting and cracking of pool balls throughout the night. The hotel itself is fairly quiet at night, but the surroundings can't be helped.    Virtually every pub and go-go bar on this street advertises rooms for rent, but the Pasadena Lodge is the only actual hotel on the street. It poses itself as a sort-of boutique hotel, but despite the faux-Thai handicraft decor, cute-colored soap and elephant-shaped towels, it's really just another hotel.    If you are going to be hanging out on the street or the nearby area, and don't mind the noise, this is an okay hotel. Otherwise, move along and find a place near the beach. I usually select lodging from the Lonely Planet's Budget category. This hotel was a 400 Baht step up from what I usually pay. Room was in their Deluxe category. It was large, well appointed and aesthetically pleasing. Most beds in budget hotels are too hard, soft, lumpy or I can feel the springs. The bed here was excellent. Staff's English was quite good, right down to their accents.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930491,100.884247&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930491,100.884247&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.930410,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.927390,100.883560|12.930444,100.885887|12.929448,100.881233|12.934750,100.883934|12.929817,100.885033|12.928950,100.884911|12.932004,100.886833&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.930843,100.881950|12.930698,100.881958|12.930793,100.882149|12.929269,100.887497|12.930620,100.879997|12.931198,100.886253&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.931111,100.884270|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774|12.928491,100.882446|12.930957,100.887589&signature=GQltyNCcYhW7yuSArr5dzyavrSY=",1.0,Positive
27,PATTAYA BEACH RESORT - Hotel Reviews (Thailand),"Right on beach but still quite.lovely big pool.also ten pin bowling alley inside motel.breakfast was good variety.walking to spas and other restaurants.big motel lots of bus tours staying but still quite.pattaya its self not as good as thought. we , as freinds were there during first week of april 2015. reached there without any hicough as it is eassily assesable. clean , Neat hotel,, rooms are specious, interior is decorated , well furnished.. the advantage of hotel is, it is very well located. you just crosss beach road and you are on beach, walking street is just 2.5 kms, for which u can hire taxi or roam around beach to reach there..alkazar show right on corner of hotel..staff is also polite they served well and arranged indian meals for us without any grin on face.. special mention for spa, its good and relaxing with good service..yaa.. swimming pool is right on street , but its clean. housekeeping is good and very honest..overall good stay will recommend just for its location and overall services they put ..yaa. go ahead..yes they allow one guest provided u want and guestis ready to put their thai card with hotel.. Pattaya beach resort is exotically located on beach with sea facing rooms. very calm and well interior done hotel in Pattaya. Luxury living and nice hospitality. their authentic Thai food is just mouth watering. Online booking was easy and special discount given. Situated on the main road hence easily accessible. Rooms are well laid, lot of cross ventilation available. Beach facing rooms are beautiful. Facilities are excellent. We had a booking through Travel Gateway our travel agent. The hotel is approx 3-3.5 star category but the location is exactly of 5 star property. Beach lover will find the place really exciting. We stayed here for 3 nights. The major attractions are very near the hotel like the walking street, most likely the Beach where you can enjoy the night life as well as the activities easily.    Moreover the staff is really very polite and helpful in nature. I was here in Feb 2013 for 4 days. I loved the location and the property. Hotels stands with an excellent beach and scenic view, but the bathrooms were small though clean and the food was not upto the mark. Positive is for location and property. I was at Pattaya Beach resort in 2009 and one of the best part of the hotel is its location. Its situated right on the beach road, next to Holiday Inn. The rooms have an excellent view of the beach and ocean only if you have booked an ocean view room. The bathrooms are small but clean and well maintained and have transparent walls and no locking systems. I still did not understand why. The mini bar was well stuffed but everything was a little pricey. The hotel is 15 minutes walk from walking street or we can also take a multiple passenger taxi for only 10 - 15 baht per passenger. One thing to notice was that the hotel had many Indian guests and it can be a little repulsive, even though I am an Indian too. In the end its budget hotel with nothing fancy except for location and a fair price. I stayed in this hotel for 2 days. Was booked here by Thomas and Cook. The rooms are not spacious. Though they say that its a Beach resort, its impossible for you to get a view of the beach from the first three floors. Food was not up to the mark and choices were very limited in the buffet breakfast. The lobby was way to small. But I liked the cute pool at the backyard. Overall a very average hotel at the maximum with terrible facilities. An avoidable place. just over looking the beach, nice property, decetly priced, helpfull staff, only bad thing about the place was room service, though this is with most of the hotels in pattaya. rooms and bathrooms were spacious and well kept. just right for what they charge, breakfast was fine with no frills attached. Friends there are many better hotels to stay in pattaya....dont even think of staying over here..u cn find many other beach side properties..buh plz dnt suggest tis to anyone...my stay was horrible and depressing..ws jst waste of money..it is a huge property..bt ws rally below all standards..verry verry rude staff..no rooom service...rude staff in breakfast counters...no managemnt..plzz try other hotels...ther r manyy... We stayed in Pattaya Beach Resort one night, we took a room for 3 persons, the most special thing in this hotel was the staff, they were very helpful, support & willing to provides you with the best service to satisfies their customers with nice smile always, as we faced a terrible night at other hotel nearby, the hotel room was clean & cozy , the location is excellent on front of the beach, we really enjoyed staying on this hotel.    Comparing the price Vs the service you will be very satisfied. Presently this hotel is named as Hotel Selection.  This is the terrible hotel i stayed ever in my trips. Though they charge about 2000+ baht, this hotel quality is below 700 Baht range. Breakfast is terrible, poor service in breakfast room, rooms have not enough lights, bathroom is half finished and water flows all the time, no towel hangers, no chairs in the room. Besides free wi fi there is no positive points to highlight. The Hotel was located at one of the best places and was near the beach, hotel not having a private beach is a drawback but never mind , the hospitality was at par , food and beverage quality even was great. stayed in feb this year the place is real value for money the hotel is right on the beach road and walking distance from the beach  there are many bars / eating places near the hotel  a lot of indians stay there but indian dishes are not there for Breakfast It was amazing experience to be in Thailand for 5 day with stay in Pattya Beach resort.  We were far from every day pressure during our time spent in Thailand. Well appointed rooms with professional service was provided by the hotel staff. We spend 3 nights in Pattaya beach resort and felt rejuvinated and relaxed. The sea was visible from the balcony and was giving a soothing feel of nature. - we will surely visit again and again to the location the hotel location is great. you can access the hotel from two streets. above all, this is a pet-friendly hotel and the room is really spacious.    even though it's quite in the center, but it's pretty quiet at night This hotel was included for us in a travel package. When I initially saw the hotel online I was somewhat skeptical of it because of the mixed reviews, but when I stepped off the shuttle in front of the hotel all the bad reviews came to life as this was one of the worst hotels I've ever been in.  Once in the lobby at the front desk I noticed dirty dishes and glasses all over the lobby that had not been picked up and a sign at the front desk counter that read, ""We do not provide sexual massages here. If you would like a sexual massage there are many places outside that we can refer you to."" As the alarms went off in my head I still tried to hold out some hope for this place. The staff seemed pleasant enough and as they gave me my room key I was told that my room had a beautiful garden view.  Upon going to my room the halls were very dimly lit and the hallway smelled of mildew and mold. Once entering the room itself it seemed as though someone came to pull the sheets over the bed but that was literally about it. Not only did the white sheets and blankets have yellow stains all over them, but the bathroom was full of black pubic hair on the counter, the floor and the toilet. As if this wasn't enough, there was dirt and dust all over the floor and the white bath towels had long black hair all over them. And oh, that beautiful garden view, was nothing more than a small patch of grass surrounded by old run down buildings surrounded by trash. My family and I were in this room no longer than 10min before leaving to catch a cab to find a room elsewhere.  As for the location, the hotel is close to beach, no doubt about it. But you do have to walk through a small area of trashy tattoo and massage parlors to get there. For the $80 US per night the travel company refunded us for this place, we were able to find a 5star resort down the street with meals included for a fraction more than this dive.  The Pattaya Beach Resort is listed as a 4star hotel. Seriously, I don't know how that's possible. 1 star would be pushing it. Avoid this place at all costs. the place and area is beautiful. the experience of city and country make you feel great and important, a truly tourist place - which gives you fun / pleasure and sinks in to business discussions. the food here is also to be tried, try some Thai dishes if you can take these Newish hotel, Very nice rooms and Clean.  Terrible Buffet Breakfast(included n plan)  Room Service is practically non-existent.  Location is okay. Mid-way up Beach road (closer to North Pattaya).  Staff is polite but impersonal.  Value for money.  Restaurant & food is definitely below standard.  Would not recommend to friends. This is one of the worst hotel in Pattaya. If you see the hotel, you wouldn't think it as a 4star hotel. The only thing I liked is free wifi. We are all together 3 people and have seen this hotel booth in a tourism exhibition. They represented themselves as a 4 stars hotel. So we decided to stay there for a short weekend trip. We paid for this hotel at 3,500 baht per night for Deluxe Seaview room. The first time we saw the hotel entrace we were shocked as it definitely not look like a 4 stars hotel as they rent out some part of the land to those shops on the street. When we checked-in, we requested for an extra bed which cost 1,060 baht. When I ask a Philippino receptionist if the hotel has any credit card promotion, she asked me how many card do I have which I consider that as a very very impolite question. After I finished checking in I turned back and saw a Bell boy playing with our belongings (Hat and personal hand bag). He also took the key card from us to take us to the room which is understandable but also put it in his MOUTH!!! The room was quiet small comparing to what we have paid for. The extra bed we have requested for turned out to be a plywood bed with bed sheet NO mattress. The water at the baht tub should run down to the drainage; however, it leak from the baht tub to the floor and the whole baht room become flooded with water. The hotel gave only 1 set of toilet kit (conton bud, shower cab). The house keeping said that even we paid for extra bed they cannot provide us one more glass and mug for coffee. When we walked out of the room the carpet at the corridor was damp and smelly. My friend went to lobby toilet and while she was washing her hands the staff was talking that there is a staff there stealing the guest possession from the room. When we were leaving the hotel the same Bell boy was helping us he was at the same time searching and criticizing the things we put in our car. SO RUDE. Believe me, if you wanna have a nice weekend never ever stay here. DO NOT believe the photos in the website of this hotel. check in took a long time. Reception lady spoke poor English. View from the balcony was great. Breakfast was average. Bathroom in all aspects were bad including the towels. check out was quick. travel desk person was very helpful. TV channels had limited scope. could have provided some chairs in the balcony to sit and enjoy the sea view. All hotels on the beach side should have facility to dry wet clothes as most of the torurists will come back from beach wet. Safety locker facility was good. great location direct at the beach road only minutes to everywhere.  had an executive suite sea facing. Very cool. living room and bathroom, lots of space.  rooms are furnished very basic and the finish in the hotel is very poor. The place is brand new and already looks like 3 years.  Housekeeping does not want to change linen as they are short of everything. had to call for towels every day as there was only one.  If you shower the entire bathroom is flooded.  Well few other hick ups here and there.  Would go back due to location and value. If you compare with other hotels, this is a good deal Pattaya Beach Resort is situated at the second road, south Pattaya. Near to the Hotel is the Big-C Mall and the Alcazar show center. The resort has very lobby and three swimming pools. Our room was near the Dolphin pool. It is a budget hotel resort. The hotel is free from the disturbance of the night life at Walking Street. As per the standard I rate it on average. The morning breakfast is served at its restaurant with moderate buffet on continental plan. There are many roadside markets and good restaurants near the hotel.    The room we stayed was spacious. The room interiors were modern and was arrange in international standard. It is lovely to spend time at the pool side, even late nights. Its very calm and quiet. One can peacefully take a good long sleep at any time of the day. we stayed at this hotel after amari orchid and guess what the rooms are better than amari orchids garden wing rooms since this is a new hotel or has gone a major renovation all the things in the room were new it is also well located a 24 hour general store shop is at the enterance of the hotel well close to indian resturents and do ask for beach facing rooms at a higher floor the winds and the scene will drive you crazy we sat for hours and talked at the balcony the ac was good as for the pool it was a bit small but a very good hotel with value for money Located to provide a great sea view from your room, this resort hotel gives you all the leisure you need. The room and service quality is pretty good. The accessibility to the market area is fantastic. You have indian restaurants nearby as well. The boats to coral island can be easily arranged from here. A perfect romantic holiday. great location, excellent accommodation, would recommend","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.943224,100.885796&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.943224,100.885796&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.943296,100.888634|12.946860,100.884850|12.941815,100.887703|12.943372,100.888023|12.942090,100.887321|12.942431,100.886154|12.945370,100.887077|12.946270,100.886261&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.945942,100.888512|12.945222,100.886719|12.945535,100.885284|12.941941,100.884735|12.942083,100.888054|12.939547,100.884132|12.945942,100.888336|12.944043,100.888626|12.945237,100.886757&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.945731,100.888847|12.947556,100.885757|12.940918,100.888573|12.939276,100.885162|12.941266,100.888710|12.945615,100.885139|12.944045,100.887093&signature=3ojmTvmfSEcHRVrnYCu1_flkXvU=",0.9999,Positive
28,"ROOF GARDEN INN - Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","loved it, everything perfect, too bad it's closed down now, been closed for several years i guess. was between pattaya and jomtien. i stayed on the 2nd floor had a balcony, i think it was about 800 baht a night I've stayed at RGI before. At 800B a night it is good value. Traffic over Xmas-NY was particularly heavy so it was a bit noisier than my previous trips. The baht buses were packed so I mainly took the motocy taxis from the corner 60-80 baht per trip, best way to travel in busy traffic.  Good firm bed, bathroom is just fine. You'll need to factor in the costs of bahtbuses, taxis or scooter-taxis (great fun that they are!) because the walk back from town is no fun in Pattaya's humidity, even in January. Not a bad hotel, no complaints with the room (wifi bit sporadic though), but owner tried to double-charge me - for which the web agency (Agoda) have since given a 15% refund. Pattaya is a fun place for youngsters but I found the sight of Arthur C Clarke reincarnated hundreds of times over, each holding the hand of a young Thai girl, rather nauseous! Only stayed for 2 nights in December but would recommend to anyone on a budget. If you're after a hotel that's relatively close to walking street then you've hit the jackpot. Can either get a cheap taxi ride to walking street or you can walk it as well - takes about 10-15 minutes to walk. Hotel itself had really good wifi connection which was included, tea & coffee and a fridge. Stayed in about 4 hotels around Thailand and would say this was the best out of the lot - you get what you pay for and more. Only issue we had was the guy on reception seemed more concerned about scamming us out of more money than actually checking us in . He advised us that there was a mix-up with our booking so we ended up having to pay a few more hunded baht! Other than the mix-up whilst checking in we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Ok so it was only one night, save money for out having fun. It does seem to be getting a little worn and uncared for, bit of mould here and there in the shower/bathroom areas. Look for this price best not to be too fussy eh? Double glazed balcony doors ensure zero noise from traffic. Nice firm large bed which I prefer, flat screen TV (why watch TV in Pattaya though). No breakfast but there are 20 places nearby with breakfast by the beach for instance, at 150 baht.    Only issue I have is there is no lift - so don't get a room high up. 1-2 floor is OK. The best so far, clean rooms, handy position between Jomptien and Pataya, but most of all the lovely staff. I can not express how much nicer a holiday can be, if you have friendly helpful people, who not only do their job well, but go the extra nine yards to make you feel very welcome indeed. If your going to pataya, then this is budget priced excellence. Highly recommended..! Before this hotel was owned and operated by a German guy, everything spotless and in ""ordnung"". Now that has changed to the worse, now it has a India owner with the result that everything is neglected and you only get water when you check in. You have to check out everyday and check in in order to get two water bottles free.    So, once this was my favorite place in Pattaya, now i would not go back.    There is no friendliness in this hotel, unless you flash money. The hotel is falling apart compared to before. The showers was dirty, so was the room.    The price seems to be about the same as before, but before you got much more for your buck!    The windows are however still thick, so it is still quiet rooms. A few weeks ago we booked a deluxe room and received a written confirmation by the owner.  today when we arrived at the hotel we were informed that they did not have the deluxe room but they had a standard room. we were upset but we had a look to the room and it was very bad, diety with no window to the outside only to the corridor and there was dak stains on the walls and in the bathroom and the sheet was dirty. A really dirty and terrible room.  I would not book any room with such people that confirm the room by email and after they do not keep their word. I stayed again at Roof Garden Inn 29 Dec to 4 Jan 2013, 700 baht a night for deluxe room with balcony, 3rd floor.    The bathroom is excellent for a room at this price, large area, nice big shower big enough for 2 people with strong water flow. Good flat-screen TV, huge king size bed and plenty of wardrobe space for your clothes. Very nice in all.    No lift so if climbing stairs is a problem this is not for you. (I had to carry my drunk girlfriend up 3 floors one night which was not so fun).    Location is halfway between Jomtien and Pattaya on a regular baht bus route (10 baht to anywhere) so it is fine for the beach in the daytime and Pattaya nightlife too.    No joiner fees for those that bring friends back for the night.    No breakfast at the hotel but many available nearby and supermarket opposite....so no problems    Note there is building construction behind the hotel at the moment, was quiet when I was on there as site was on holiday, could be a nuisance in the afternoons if you like to sleep then.    The windows at the front are double glazed so you do not get any traffic noise if closed..... I was referred to this hotel by a friend. I must say for the price it is really good value. The hotel is clean, the rooms are great. Every thing you need. And the staff was so friendly and helpful. It was just superb. I will gladly recommend this hotel. Having read favourable reviews of RGI I decided to book and stay for 3 nights recently, in April. We stayed in the deluxe with balcony which was quite satisfactory, clean, comfortable king bed, and great bathroom with shower and good water pressure (something that can be a bit hit and miss in Pattaya-Jomtien). The staff were quite friendly, and the rate at 700 baht per night (no breakfast) was very good. The location halfway between Pattaya and Jomtien, on the baht bus route (10 baht per trip) is quite good as you can do the better Jomtien beach in the daytime, then all the shopping and Pattaya nightlife in the evening. There is construction of an apartment block behind the hotel so there is a bit of building noise during the day, nights are fine. Great rooms, and awesome shower...  Great friendly receptionist...great value for money considering the excellent standard of rooms.....well worth visit... I have stayed here several times over the past 5 or 6 years and have always had the same level of experience staying here. The staff is very , very nice and the other hotel patrons have always been friendly , being a smaller place than , say , a high-rise where there are hundreds of people coming and going. It is clean and you just cannot do better for the price. Everything is in good working order , a well-designed bathroom and overall pretty drag comfortable. There are , I think , 4 floors and there is no lift, but it is certainly not a deal-breaker for me. There are dining options in the neighborhood. The hotel offers high speed internet for free, as well. I believe toast and coffee is available to guests free , although I did not partake. Lastly, I actually like the location as it is approximately equi-distant between Pattaya and Jomtien and it is a quiet neighborhood at night. Alot of us appreciate that because , if you get in the wrong place in Patts, you are subject to quite an onslaught of party noise. Not for me , thanks. I highly recommend Roof Garden Inn as it is an excellent value for your money spent. I hope they are always around for me to return to on future trips to the area. I give it a 5 star rating because of what you receive in return for the extremely reasonable rate, but it is not a 5 star hotel , per se. No in the same sense that the Dusit Thani or the Hilton or any of the high end places are. But , you'd be paying at least 10 times the amount per night. I have stayed here several time since January 2009, and while the road works between Pattaya and Jomtien can get a bit dusty, its a great location for quick travel in either direction via the cheap baht buses.    Its well run, clean, secure, inexpensive, good location and friendly staff.    On the down side they dont have a lift so if you have a lot of luggage or mobility problems ask for the first floor. Some of the rooms do realy smell of smoking, it would be better if they had some No-smoking rooms. They have two classes of room but the only real differnace in that the Delux are at the front with a balconey and the Superior have this slightly weird goldfish bowl set up with the window opening out onto the corridor (you spend a lot of time with the curtains closed). While there are tea/coffee making facilties in the room, there is no tea/coffee/sugar/milk provided so unless you go out to 7/11 and buy your own they just dont get used.    I still think this is a great little place for the price and choose to stay there when in pattaya...if you want 4 * go to the Mariat and pay accordingly....for anything from 500-800 baht this is great. Sayed 3 nights. Clean modern guesthouse. Liked the separate shower rather than typical wet room of most guest houses. On main road but room well insulated from noise.Easy access to nightlife on baht bus. Coffe and toast available. Very friendly staff. Date of Stay: March, 2009  My room window looked into the corridor that was the access to all the rooms .It was like living in an aquarium,everyone peering in unless you kept the curtains closed! The rooms are nice and clean. No food is served. The location is neither in Pattaya nor Jomtien, meaning Baht buses or taxi's to everywhere. It's more a guest house than a hotel,on the constantly busy main road to Jomtein beach and the roof garden is behind a locked gate with no access for guests. Stayed 3 days ,could not be bothered with having to get transport everywhere,it's in no mans land!Stay again ? Never. I been here a few times and i think its good that the skipped the thaigirl theme at this hotel. You check in for the hotel, not girls. The location is not the best, but its very easy to get anywhere from the bath-pickups outside so it does matter much to me. The rooms are fitted with extra good windows so noice stays outside. No breakfast is served but 20 meter to the right they have ok breakfast. I strongly feel that if they cut the price a bit it would attract more people, especially low season. Low-season you can get a great deal om most hotels in Pattaya, just dont be shy and dont tell the others at the hotel.    Now people hesitate since its in the middle from Pattaya and Jomtien. They do have Internet, but they should really upgrade the equipment to wireless. Its cheap nowadays and the box they provide is not state of the art.  7eleven is about 150 meters away across busy road. loved it, everything perfect, too bad it's closed down now, been closed for several years i guess. was between pattaya and jomtien. i stayed on the 2nd floor had a balcony, i think it was about 800 baht a night I've stayed at RGI before. At 800B a night it is good value. Traffic over Xmas-NY was particularly heavy so it was a bit noisier than my previous trips. The baht buses were packed so I mainly took the motocy taxis from the corner 60-80 baht per trip, best way to travel in busy traffic.  Good firm bed, bathroom is just fine. You'll need to factor in the costs of bahtbuses, taxis or scooter-taxis (great fun that they are!) because the walk back from town is no fun in Pattaya's humidity, even in January. Not a bad hotel, no complaints with the room (wifi bit sporadic though), but owner tried to double-charge me - for which the web agency (Agoda) have since given a 15% refund. Pattaya is a fun place for youngsters but I found the sight of Arthur C Clarke reincarnated hundreds of times over, each holding the hand of a young Thai girl, rather nauseous! Only stayed for 2 nights in December but would recommend to anyone on a budget. If you're after a hotel that's relatively close to walking street then you've hit the jackpot. Can either get a cheap taxi ride to walking street or you can walk it as well - takes about 10-15 minutes to walk. Hotel itself had really good wifi connection which was included, tea & coffee and a fridge. Stayed in about 4 hotels around Thailand and would say this was the best out of the lot - you get what you pay for and more. Only issue we had was the guy on reception seemed more concerned about scamming us out of more money than actually checking us in . He advised us that there was a mix-up with our booking so we ended up having to pay a few more hunded baht! Other than the mix-up whilst checking in we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Ok so it was only one night, save money for out having fun. It does seem to be getting a little worn and uncared for, bit of mould here and there in the shower/bathroom areas. Look for this price best not to be too fussy eh? Double glazed balcony doors ensure zero noise from traffic. Nice firm large bed which I prefer, flat screen TV (why watch TV in Pattaya though). No breakfast but there are 20 places nearby with breakfast by the beach for instance, at 150 baht.    Only issue I have is there is no lift - so don't get a room high up. 1-2 floor is OK. The best so far, clean rooms, handy position between Jomptien and Pataya, but most of all the lovely staff. I can not express how much nicer a holiday can be, if you have friendly helpful people, who not only do their job well, but go the extra nine yards to make you feel very welcome indeed. If your going to pataya, then this is budget priced excellence. Highly recommended..! Before this hotel was owned and operated by a German guy, everything spotless and in ""ordnung"". Now that has changed to the worse, now it has a India owner with the result that everything is neglected and you only get water when you check in. You have to check out everyday and check in in order to get two water bottles free.    So, once this was my favorite place in Pattaya, now i would not go back.    There is no friendliness in this hotel, unless you flash money. The hotel is falling apart compared to before. The showers was dirty, so was the room.    The price seems to be about the same as before, but before you got much more for your buck!    The windows are however still thick, so it is still quiet rooms. A few weeks ago we booked a deluxe room and received a written confirmation by the owner.  today when we arrived at the hotel we were informed that they did not have the deluxe room but they had a standard room. we were upset but we had a look to the room and it was very bad, diety with no window to the outside only to the corridor and there was dak stains on the walls and in the bathroom and the sheet was dirty. A really dirty and terrible room.  I would not book any room with such people that confirm the room by email and after they do not keep their word. I stayed again at Roof Garden Inn 29 Dec to 4 Jan 2013, 700 baht a night for deluxe room with balcony, 3rd floor.    The bathroom is excellent for a room at this price, large area, nice big shower big enough for 2 people with strong water flow. Good flat-screen TV, huge king size bed and plenty of wardrobe space for your clothes. Very nice in all.    No lift so if climbing stairs is a problem this is not for you. (I had to carry my drunk girlfriend up 3 floors one night which was not so fun).    Location is halfway between Jomtien and Pattaya on a regular baht bus route (10 baht to anywhere) so it is fine for the beach in the daytime and Pattaya nightlife too.    No joiner fees for those that bring friends back for the night.

29,"ROYAL HERITAGE PAVILION, JOMTIEN - Updated 2022 Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","I would recommend and come back again    The views are amazing and a great location, the staff are decent and try their best, which I appreciated.    Facilities are good, and there are decent options for children with a kid's pool on level 2. Good for couples, or families and reasonably priced.    The suites would be great for hosting a decent sized group to celebrate the new year.    The decor is Thai Traditional and not modern decor, so don't expect that. Some design flaws are clearly stated, but can be overlooked due to the rest of the facilities.    Atmosphere is relaxed and if you don't expect 5 star anything goes, at 5 star prices you'll be satisfied.    Understand the staff enforces hotel policies, so they don't have the leeway to cater to all requests. Expect to pay for additional add-ons which may be clearly stated in your booking policies. I loved this hotel. room with access to pool. Staff was awesome. Food was very good. Room was very nice. we loved the Asian decor. Kind of far from Pattaya & Baht buses don‚Äôt like driving that far. But it‚Äôs worth it. I will be back. A very tired and shabby hotel, in need of renovation. Don‚Äôt be deceived by the photos on the website.    Pool area, although on the roof offering good views, was old and required refurbishment.    The bed was uncomfortable, with old sheets and a thin duvet. The pillows were worn out and you needed three instead of one as they were so thin.    The breakfast was poor, with little choice. Very slow replenishment of the buffet-style food and most of it cold.    Restaurant floor dirty, as were the tables.    To sum up: an old, overpriced hotel that needs a full make-over. Overbooked and didnt have our room available also downgraded us with a cheap room and wouldn't refund any difference. Very bad service and hotel in general would not recommend. Lots of mosquitos ate us alive I Booked a room there two weeks in advance for the date of 18th of march 2017 by Expedia.com. But The receptionist said there is no room available when we arrived around 3:30 pm at hotel , offered me to come back next day to get a room but waited for 4 hours finally got a room with not a nice view after i have phoned to agent and I have requested to see a manager but no manager in the property and they only give me a email address of manager . of course there was no response when I send email.    Staff are not helpful at all and only insist the guest that to call expedia.com or come back next day. My lovely wife and I stayed here in late March. In general it was a good stay and we would definitely consider staying here again.  The hotel is in a good location, across the road from the beach. It is a reasonably quiet area, however not too far to walk or jump on the baht bus for a bit of nightlife etc  There were issues with wifi for 2 days but eventually sorted.  Our rate included breakfast. To be honest, the breakfast was below par.  Overall it was a good stay. Would recommend hotel to others. Location and value for money. This is not a 4 star hotel or even close to it. At best it would be a 2 1/2 stars. The staff are rude and the fact I am in the land of smiles and yet to see one at the Royal Heritage just about sums it up. Avoid if you can. The rooms have no real amenities like tea or coffee which you would expect from a 4* hotel. We had to call room service back 3 times to clean the bathroom enough for us to go in it.    There is not a single working umbrella in the hotel so you either sit in the boiling hot sun or your room - not a single piece of shade anywhere.    I have stayed in lots of hotels all over Thailand and some of them have been extremely basic but the friendly staff have been a redeeming feature or the clean rooms or excellent breakfast etc.    This hotel does not have a single redeeming feature all the drinks are overpriced the service is poor, the food is poor, the rooms are dirty the pool is dirty (yesterday there were floating cigarette's in the pool) and the debris around the edge of the pool has been there for the last couple of days that we have been here.........    Better options available at better prices so don't bother - looks like they have big tour parties so have completely given up on customer service. This was the worst experience in over 20 years travelling to Thailand. Staff is not attentive. Only interested in their mobile Phone and the buss loads of Chinese comming in every day. Tried to deliver laundry, but it would cost 2 days and 10 (!!!) Times the price of the laundry around the corner. When I wanted to speak to the manager about another issue I could only reach him by Email. I wrote an email but of course no reply. ....  Only interested in one time visitors, Will never go back! Just spent 2 weeks here and after the lack of reviews on here and worrying reviews on agodo really felt we had booked a really poor hotel.  We arrived around 9 pm and were met with chaos on reception and a few cats so didn't start well. We then had to pay 1000 bhat to cover the mini bar. We then were given wifi codes and advised breakfast vouchers would be issued, we did not book breakfast so this was a bonus.    We got to the room and the key didn't work.it's a contactless card type so had to get it reprogrammed we were told a additional key would have an extra charge so didn't bother,the room was of a good size on the 9th floor with secluded balcony and sea view. The room could have done with more storage and hangers but was ok. The bathroom was nice size but could have had a deep clean around the shower edges where it was quite mouldy. The shower itself was brilliant though really powerful and hot. The air con in the room was also excellent.  As the first day passed and we got to find our bearings we really liked the hotel position just across the road from the beach and close to local restaurant and shops.. The 10bhat bus was easy to use as well although the didn't alllways go up as far up as the hotel so sometimes had to walk some of the way back but not a problem.    At times I think we were the only guests in the hotel and at weekends it was packed mainly with Asian tourists .  The pools were nice but started to go green on 2nd week so we didn't use them. Also the gym was closed but we never wanted to use that. A bar would have been nice but there are many close by.    Overall the hotel is fine but the beds were quite hard, the rooms were however cleaned daily and 2 bottles of water delivered each day Which was nice.    I would not rate it as a 4 star but for the price we paid was more than acceptable. Although we had breakfast vouchers we never used them as always got up too late and missed it.    As we checked our in the early hours the 1000 bhat was returned as we didn't use the mini bar. The security guard though was fast asleep as we left so waste of time him being on duty    Ideal as a base and if you get a good deal worth booking this hotel but it's not a high service hotel. We have stayed here a few times, but not since they built the extension. And found this Hotel very nice. But since they have done the extension, the only fault I could find was the staff, once away from the check in desk, all needed to smarten up, the cloths they wore looked very dirty. This was a real put off. I would recommend and come back again    The views are amazing and a great location, the staff are decent and try their best, which I appreciated.

The 10bhat bus was easy to use as well although the didn't alllways go up as far up as the hotel so sometimes had to walk some of the way back but not a problem.    At times I think we were the only guests in the hotel and at weekends it was packed mainly with Asian tourists .  The pools were nice but started to go green on 2nd week so we didn't use them. Also the gym was closed but we never wanted to use that. A bar would have been nice but there are many close by.    Overall the hotel is fine but the beds were quite hard, the rooms were however cleaned daily and 2 bottles of water delivered each day Which was nice.    I would not rate it as a 4 star but for the price we paid was more than acceptable. Although we had breakfast vouchers we never used them as always got up too late and missed it.    As we checked our in the early hours the 1000 bhat was returned as we didn't use the mini bar. The security guard though was fast asleep as we left so waste of time him being on duty    Ideal as a base and if you get a good deal worth booking this hotel but it's not a high service hotel. We have stayed here a few times, but not since they built the extension. And found this Hotel very nice. But since they have done the extension, the only fault I could find was the staff, once away from the check in desk, all needed to smarten up, the cloths they wore looked very dirty. This was a real put off. I would recommend and come back again    The views are amazing and a great location, the staff are decent and try their best, which I appreciated.    Facilities are good, and there are decent options for children with a kid's pool on level 2. Good for couples, or families and reasonably priced.    The suites would be great for hosting a decent sized group to celebrate the new year.    The decor is Thai Traditional and not modern decor, so don't expect that. Some design flaws are clearly stated, but can be overlooked due to the rest of the facilities.    Atmosphere is relaxed and if you don't expect 5 star anything goes, at 5 star prices you'll be satisfied.    Understand the staff enforces hotel policies, so they don't have the leeway to cater to all requests. Expect to pay for additional add-ons which may be clearly stated in your booking policies. I loved this hotel. room with access to pool. Staff was awesome. Food was very good. Room was very nice. we loved the Asian decor. Kind of far from Pattaya & Baht buses don‚Äôt like driving that far. But it‚Äôs worth it. I will be back. A very tired and shabby hotel, in need of renovation. Don‚Äôt be deceived by the photos on the website.    Pool area, although on the roof offering good views, was old and required refurbishment.    The bed was uncomfortable, with old sheets and a thin duvet. The pillows were worn out and you needed three instead of one as they were so thin.    The breakfast was poor, with little choice. Very slow replenishment of the buffet-style food and most of it cold.    Restaurant floor dirty, as were the tables.    To sum up: an old, overpriced hotel that needs a full make-over. Overbooked and didnt have our room available also downgraded us with a cheap room and wouldn't refund any difference. Very bad service and hotel in general would not recommend. Lots of mosquitos ate us alive I Booked a room there two weeks in advance for the date of 18th of march 2017 by Expedia.com. But The receptionist said there is no room available when we arrived around 3:30 pm at hotel , offered me to come back next day to get a room but waited for 4 hours finally got a room with not a nice view after i have phoned to agent and I have requested to see a manager but no manager in the property and they only give me a email address of manager . of course there was no response when I send email.    Staff are not helpful at all and only insist the guest that to call expedia.com or come back next day. My lovely wife and I stayed here in late March. In general it was a good stay and we would definitely consider staying here again.  The hotel is in a good location, across the road from the beach. It is a reasonably quiet area, however not too far to walk or jump on the baht bus for a bit of nightlife etc  There were issues with wifi for 2 days but eventually sorted.  Our rate included breakfast. To be honest, the breakfast was below par.  Overall it was a good stay. Would recommend hotel to others. Location and value for money. This is not a 4 star hotel or even close to it. At best it would be a 2 1/2 stars. The staff are rude and the fact I am in the land of smiles and yet to see one at the Royal Heritage just about sums it up. Avoid if you can. The rooms have no real amenities like tea or coffee which you would expect from a 4* hotel. We had to call room service back 3 times to clean the bathroom enough for us to go in it.    There is not a single working umbrella in the hotel so you either sit in the boiling hot sun or your room - not a single piece of shade anywhere.    I have stayed in lots of hotels all over Thailand and some of them have been extremely basic but the friendly staff have been a redeeming feature or the clean rooms or excellent breakfast etc.    This hotel does not have a single redeeming feature all the drinks are overpriced the service is poor, the food is poor, the rooms are dirty the pool is dirty (yesterday there were floating cigarette's in the pool) and the debris around the edge of the pool has been there for the last couple of days that we have been here.........    Better options available at better prices so don't bother - looks like they have big tour parties so have completely given up on customer service. This was the worst experience in over 20 years travelling to Thailand. Staff is not attentive. Only interested in their mobile Phone and the buss loads of Chinese comming in every day. Tried to deliver laundry, but it would cost 2 days and 10 (!!!) Times the price of the laundry around the corner. When I wanted to speak to the manager about another issue I could only reach him by Email. I wrote an email but of course no reply. ....  Only interested in one time visitors, Will never go back! Just spent 2 weeks here and after the lack of reviews on here and worrying reviews on agodo really felt we had booked a really poor hotel.  We arrived around 9 pm and were met with chaos on reception and a few cats so didn't start well. We then had to pay 1000 bhat to cover the mini bar. We then were given wifi codes and advised breakfast vouchers would be issued, we did not book breakfast so this was a bonus.    We got to the room and the key didn't work.it's a contactless card type so had to get it reprogrammed we were told a additional key would have an extra charge so didn't bother,the room was of a good size on the 9th floor with secluded balcony and sea view. The room could have done with more storage and hangers but was ok. The bathroom was nice size but could have had a deep clean around the shower edges where it was quite mouldy. The shower itself was brilliant though really powerful and hot. The air con in the room was also excellent.  As the first day passed and we got to find our bearings we really liked the hotel position just across the road from the beach and close to local restaurant and shops.. The 10bhat bus was easy to use as well although the didn't alllways go up as far up as the hotel so sometimes had to walk some of the way back but not a problem.

30,"SHOOTERS GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","Well It‚Äôs above a go go bar, so you should know what you are getting yourself in to. Don‚Äôt expect to Go to sleep anytime before 3am.    Other than that it‚Äôs perfect!! You do need to pay 1000 baht deposit on the room - in cash. I stayed in Shooters Soi 7 for 16 nights, The worst choice of my life never again. I didn't get hardly any sleep as the loud music goes on until 3 am. Every time I used something they asked for money. I would not recommend this place to anybody I was so pleased to leave. Shooters Guesthouse is 8 rooms inside the same building with the loudest Go Go Bar on Soi 7. With 40 dancers, hotel rooms above are a minor part of the operation. A reception desk is staffed while the bar is up and running (8 hours per day).    There is no separate entrance (and no means of egress, either) so you must come and go through the bar. From 7:00 PM to 3:00 AM, every night, the entire building pounds with thumping nightclub bass. Of the 8 rooms, only #7 or #8 are remotely bearable (3rd floor, rear) if you don‚Äôt stay up or out that late each and every night.    Beyond these negatives (for most), I had two bigger problems with Shooters.    First, after realizing my error (there was no warning on Agoda - or any hotel booking website), I shortened my 5-day stay to 3 nights. The hotel refused to offer any refund (lesson learned: never book any hotel that won‚Äôt refund any portion of a pre-paid reservation or accept cancellation a day or two in advance).    Second, there were 12 fire extinguishers - that had been inspected or recharged - sitting in a corridor, and they stayed there for the entire duration. There were no fire extinguishers distributed throughout the building - nor was there any fire sprinkler or alternative fire suppression system. Once inside, behind and above the bar, you are locked in, with windows too small to escape through. In other words, there was visible disregard for life-safety.    There are many better options in Pattaya. Its a decent place - good facilities - great bar - and if you plan on sleeping before 3 am dont pick here. But in fariness - if you arent (and who would pick here if you were) its a good place to be. Deposit is 1000b on check in and no hassles collecting it on check out I come to this place a lot since it opened. Every time I'm in pattaya I come in everyday for a few drinks and a game of pool here and there. It's a nice place and bar the staff are very kind to me and treat me nice This was my fourth time staying in about 3 years. Rooms still cleaned daily to high standard and new linen every other day. Wifi strong and reliable and in room safe. Guest friendly above a Coyote Bar with very friendly ladies. Rooms have excellent air con and being in Soi 7 is very centrally placed for food and drink. Owners and staff very welcoming as always. Stayed here plenty of times. Rooms are very Clean and Comfortable. Nice beds and great TV. Rainfall showers all Glass. The Staff is very friendly always make you feel at home. Also a fun area and plenty of street carts if your hungry .Will stay here again for sure. Second time at Shooters and the very good rooms still have the most comfortable beds in Pattaya, only problem I had was my planning after first booking room I changed my dates due to work commitments but there was no refund on the first booking so be sure of dates before booking....apart from this all is good. Excellent clean room with plenty of area, properly one of the most comfortable beds I've had in Asia. The trip back to the room a little later at night is very interesting walking through the bar, its hard not to stop and drink with the Shooters girls and your mad if you don't.... Plenty of restaurants and nightlife all around and you can use the great pool at the Hotel across the road for bt100. located at the beginning of the soi 7 shooters and a night bar very nice and beautiful girls. in the upper part, there are the rooms, very spacious, clean and equipped with everything you need. wifi free and running, there is breakfast. not recommended for families because of the music that ends a little later in the room below. for others ok. My third time here and again stayed a month. Rooms as ever large comfortable and kept spotlessly clean by fine cleaner. Bed large and comfortable with great remote controlled air con. Bathroom modern and large with excellent walk in style rain shower. Linen changed every other day. Toiletries and bottled water included. In room digital safe and free wi fi also. Easy walking distance of bars, restaurants, shops and laundries. Rooms on second floor are quieter. Out of hours access is by RFID key supplied on room key. Accommodation is guest friendly.  Bar is great fun with the coyote dancers and special events but drinks are a little expensive so take care on bar bill.  A great place to stay and have a drink. Bar has an excellent full sized pool table free to use. My second stay at Shooters and no regrets,rooms are big and clean,happy to see they have still kept there standards up,will definitely will returning soon,big shout out to no58,41 and 27 from the boys ;) The rooms are class A.  great showers, comfy beds and a kettle to make tea of coffee big flat screen TV and freezing a/c.  Every night there's a party in the bar downstairs and if you are in to it the girls that work there are very nice and not just for money or lady drinks This was my second stay in 6 months this time for a full month. Once again the staff and owners (Jon and Eid) were very welcoming and friendly. The rooms again were large, modern and kept spotlessly clean with new linens and towels every other day. Additional toiletries are supplied. The rooms are above a Coyote Bar with sexy lady dancers and open till 3am so there is some noise in the rooms but I rather enjoyed that ! The Coyotes are friendly and fun and are up for a chat and game of pool. The guesthouse is guest friendly and secure. RDIF key access and CCTV cameras on each floor. The rooms have digital safes and strong Wi-Fi and superb air con that keeps the room very cool. The showers are large walk in rain shower type that are wonderful. The guesthouse and bar are very centrally situated in Soi 7 with many bars, restaurants and laundries all within walking distance. The price of the rooms are also great value. Stayed here end of january only 2 nights ""my fault"" rooms superb and staff really helpfull, some of the nicest people i met in pattaya, didnt get chance to meet the owners but jon/gem? meant to be really nice people as well..on another note this place isnt for the quiet & boring deffo a party place to be I have just returned after 3 great weeks at Shooters and have already booked a return visit. I will split this review into 2 parts i.e rooms/bars.    Room  *******  The rooms are big, modern and have very little clutter in them. There is a digital safe and free wi fi which is quite strong. The bathroom is modern and a superb large walk in shower.The lady cleaner keeps the rooms spotless and you get 2 bottles of complimentary water each day and fresh linen every other day. Especially notable is the air con is excellent. You can get the room very cold so much that I had to turn it off a couple of times!!Yes in your room you can hear music from the bar downstairs (it stops at 3am) but what do you expect at a bar/guesthouse. It's not that loud to be honest.    Bar  ****  Don't make the same mistake as me in that this is a coyote bar not a typical Pattaya Beer Bar where to the bar ladies are pushy and will approach you. I just sat quietly the first couple of times and the girls will not hassle you. You need to make an effort to speak to a coyote or buy on a drink you like dancing. Once you have broken the ice the girls are lovely. Will spend time with you, flirt and play and always willing to give you a game of pool on their quality pool table (if you like a challenge try Coyote Number 9 she is the number 1 player there and great fun).  The bar is fun and entertaining always and the girls are top quality and well paid. The bar fine is high (1000THB) but the girls are top notch.    Summary  ***********  Highly recommended for room or just a visit to the bar. You wont regret it. Awesome, best ever stay in pattaya,very spacious rooms,reasonably priced,ideal location (SOI 7) rooms were cleaned every day, shower worked perfectly. Air conditioned rooms ,modern decor..staff were very friendly (keep up the good work)..many thanks to JON and EID! Thanks 2 everyone who made my holiday an unforgettable 1, Glenn from Whitehaven, Cumbria, England ! ! ! Pattaya Beach Road soi 7. Great Location. Clean specious rooms.But the Shower place has some problems. Take some to to dry. Friendly owner and staffs.At evening there is a good ladyboy bar. Very near to all other entertainment. Good place to stay.There is no front desk from 3AM onwards.If you have RFID key you can only enter. Ok. This was a bit expensive in relation to the bars all around it BUT the place is very nice and the women are beautiful. The girls are paid a very high wage and are less likely to go with you as a result as they don't need the money. I liked this to be honest. Good to see a boss who pays well for good staff.    The bar next door ""Ricks Bar"" is an excellent bar too. Cheap and friendly. Great. Well run guest house brilliant staff a very happy place to stay, great location near lots of bars and good eating houses, very clean place to stay at a very good price, the owners were very helpful. I did not want to leave, Great location off the Beach Road in the North of Pattaya, easy to get anywhere on the blue baht buses/pickups. The bar during the day is deserted, but at 8pm it comes alive...and alive it stays...until about 4am, like the rest of Pattaya...I was on the 2nd floor, and you could still hear the music but it wasn't too obtrusive and by that time I was ready for some deep sleep anyway. There's a 1000 baht deposit on arrival, and there was no ""fun and games"" trying to get it back on check-out. All very above-board. All the staff are very very friendly and accommodating. There's no lift incidentally. The shower wasn't too keen on dispensing hot water at any point during my stay. Tepid was the best I managed, but it's so hot outside, you're not really after hot showers. The aircon would freeze a penguin if you turn it on. WiFi was excellent, I even downloaded several films (legally of course ;-) while I was there, no problem. There's a stocked fridge (without a tariff, but the shooters branded water is free) and some other items available you don't normally find in a hotel...as well as plenty of takeaway options...This is a hotel for single guys, I'll leave it at that. 800 Baht bar fine (allegedly). There's a 7-11 right outside and there's PLENTY of life in the area. I'd visit again, although I did find out some people staying there got a better ""Walk in rate"" than I did with Agoda. Stayed in shooters for a week in April not knowing that was Thai New Year and celebrated by the Water Festival. Had a great week, Shooters was very comfortable with extremely friendly staff. Fantastic value for money and top location in Soi 7 near the entertainment areas. No need to venture away from this place. Found it extremely difficult to leave there due to how much fun it is. Even on the nights I would go check out other bars, I would end up back there every night. The main highlights for me were;    -Beautiful clean rooms at a great price.  -Fabulous bar with a pool table and gorgeous dancers.  -Meet many great people from all over the world.  -Great staff and wonderful owners (Jon and Eid). Be sure to meet them as they are very accommodating and will do they're best to make sure you have the most memorable trip to Pattaya. Wonderful place..very friendly for ALL nationalities..worth the price..rooms are exactly as you see in the pictures.  Great practical advice given by John and best of luck to their hotel.  KEEP room no:7 for me....its (suppossedly) MIINEEE!!!!!  The bathroom is good with a wonderful shower.Nice wifi. Great staff.  Hope they remember all of us.....as i would surely remember them..one advice take individual rooms....coz you will be tempted.  Pratik a.k.a Gustavo.a.k.a G.T The ""BEST"" hotel in soi 7 second road .The friendly staff .Its like a heaven in pattaya its a beautiful place .awesome rooms and its a value for money .The most important thing is the owners are so friendly and very helpful and they guide us very nicely .missing shooters alot . Shooters has a friendly staff and owner. The Coyote Bar (downstairs) is the best you will find in the area. They are friendly Top Rate dancers (and excellent pool players, I might add).    The rooms are spacious and clean. The bathroom's ""rain shower"" is nice with ample hot water.    There are eateries (some Western), a 7-11, motorbike rental, airport taxi service, and a Laundry Cleaners nearby.    It's a friendly 10 minute walk to the beach (well lit at night with bars along the way)    The price was affordable (comparatively speaking).    Unfortunately, I have to choose ""loud"" on the questionnaire. Obviously, with a ""night club/bar"" on the ground floor, the sound of the bass speakers is going to resonate throughout the building (until about 1AM). But, I was used to it by the second night and it didn't bother me the rest of my stay.    I'll certainly stay there again when I come back to Pattaya (if it's not so popular by then that it's fully booked).    -Eric I normally stay in and around LK Metro but felt like a change and found Shooters on the web, I was a little concerned about the noise from Soi 7 but didn't need to worry, the rooms were like new and very spacious, shower was great, air con worked well and having the go go bar downstairs meant plenty of eye candy, staff were helpful and so was Jon the boss, rates were good and like the title location was great If you want to be in the centre of the action look no further than Shooters guest house. From the great service, very friendly staff and lively atmosphere to the extremely comfy beds, you will not be disappointed.  Spacious rooms, walk in rain shower, air-con, wifi, safe, very modern and clean.  I was very happy with my stay at Shooters and will be back. I strayed from my normal accommodation as shooters is new and new usually means new beds.I'd say the best Sleep I've had in a long time.The rooms are very spacious and a big rain shower which was really lovely.Vert spacious shower,can easily fit 3 in.The bar downstairs has a really great sound system and a pro pool table.The staff I have to say are some of nicest I have ever had the privilege of meeting.The coyote girls are the best looking I have seen around Town.What more can I say,the only one negative is the drapes are abit on the thin side.Could do with a Sun screen as the morning Sun can be blazing.Enough said ,fine fine establishment. Could of asked for better, rooms excellent, clean with more that enough room, TV internet was also available. The staff were very accommodating with nothing being to much trouble. Add to this the great scooters bar and girls then what else can your ask for. Will be the only place for and my friends to stay in pattaya in the future. Great new guesthouse in soi 7 called shooters, with large clean well furnished rooms, friendly staff and great coyote bar downstairs. Location is also great, walking distance to beach and central shopping We have stayed there 3 times and really liked it there, nice and clean rooms, very friendly and helpful staff. Great location, just a few min walk to the beach, shopping malls, bars & restaurants, etc. Its perfect for those who like to have fun and enjoy the night life :)","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.935967,100.885803&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.935967,100.885803&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.936627,100.886177|12.935137,100.882889|12.937580,100.883362|12.932666,100.884048|12.934132,100.887672|12.935380,100.885674|12.934750,100.883934|12.937229,100.884453|12.936051,100.883698&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.935059,100.882851|12.937224,100.885033|12.936464,100.886726|12.934995,100.882263|12.935244,100.882774|12.934985,100.882736|12.937283,100.884842|12.937125,100.884697|12.939547,100.884132&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.935092,100.882813|12.939276,100.885162|12.937654,100.887779|12.936786,100.887123|12.938490,100.885086|12.933731,100.888527|12.936059,100.885422|12.935520,100.885040|12.935594,100.884171&signature=8sDSbmhMQp9PzaAQLN2SM5kEQ74=",1.0,Positive
31,"STEFAN'S GUESTHOUSE - Prices & Guest house Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand)","I cannot fault this hotel in any possible way and I'm a little fussy with small details.    Stayed for almost a month and all staff encountered including Stefan were very friendly and helpful.    One of the cheapest places to stay in Jomtien area and great location in soi 4 about a 2 minute walk to the beach and main road.    my room was very spacious, comfortable bed and I liked that it has both AC and fan option. Didn't opt for a balcony room as I hardly use a balcony but there was a table and 2 chairs in the room which was very adequate.    I didn't have breakfast during my time there because I prefer to sleep a few more hours in the morning so I can't comment on that but I'm sure it's up to excellent standards.    Thank you for the wonderful stay. Highly recommend your hotel to anyone. Next time I'm in the area I will only stay with you. small room without window on the first floor    but clean and with aircon    bed clean and confortable    Several steps to Jomtien beach. Also walk 20mins can go to pattaya night market. Jomtien beach is more quite, less crowded than pattaya beach.    bathroom is clean    staff friendly Everyone there was so nice right when I arrived, they treat you very well. The rooms are clean and the air conditioning is very cold. Stayed for a week and had no problems what so ever, it is in the perfect location only a few steps from the beach. Always had the breakfast there in the morning before starting my day and would recommend it to anyone. Definitely going back! Very helpful and serviceminded staff, the rooms are not new but well kept and very clean.  Great location.  At departure day the boss let me do a late check out without any extra cost, much appreciated.  Good wifi.  I recommend this guesthouse We had wonderful stay at the hotel. Friendly staff and very helpful.the room is spacious and very clean.great location just step away from the beach and restaurants.. definitely will come back here again.will recommend this place to my friends too üòäüòä I am resubmitting this in case the first attempt did not make it. As always we were made very welcome, the staff are very helpful and friendly. This time we tried the back rooms and whilst they were smaller and had no balcony, they were clean, tidy and quieter than the larger rooms at the front with balcony. Very good value for money with breakfast included in the rate charged. The arrangements for the transport and the golf by Stefan's worked very well. Will always be happy to go back and invariably wish each time I could stay longer. Stayed for 6 days in May. Started in a small double room but was able to get a free upgrade to a bigger room after 2 days. Friendly and helpful staff. Only downside is was that the towels were very old thin and quite often patched. Although clean did not leave a good impression. Not the cheapest but is well situated near beach and bars and restaurants. Two thumbs down, had a horrible experience with the management/ owner. All over a misunderstanding the police were called out, our money returned and thrown out on the street with two small children, luggage and pouring down rain at 12 midnight! Will never return. In the past booked a group of 12 golfers from Australian there for a weeks stay. Not one complaint. This time it was my need for a room. Highly recommend the hotel for location, staff, food and cleanliness of the room. For say a 3 star hotel, brilliant. This is a guest house in Jomtien/Pattaya that was a nice surprise. After deciding to stay another night in the area we just took a taxi to beach road in Jomtien and ended up at Stefan's. The room had a fairly new AC, but it did in fact lit up the room at night due to the LED light that sows it was on.    The rooms were clean and the receptionist could speak English very well. The resonnable room price included breakfast that was a selection of different country specialities like American, Belgic, French etc. It was in fact more expensive to have a few toasts with jam, than a full breakfast.    Unfortunately they were fully booket the next night so we had to move to another place after this. It was free WiFi but it has stability issues, so probably not suited for video calls or similar. Probably my 11th visit to Stefan's Guesthouse accompanied this time, by seven like minded long-term friends. Stefan's is located a few miles south of busy and noisy Pattaya, in the smaller town of Jomtien, yet has close access to the beach, a few bars and assorted restaurants.    The Guest House itself, which is quite extensive, is not greatly up-market, yet is comfortable, clean, air conditioned, with WiFi, TV etc., and reasonable priced. An over-riding reason for my repeated returns to Stefan's is the staff, who are absolutely splendid, with nothing being ""too much trouble"". Stayed here with family for a day and had a good experience.  I booked this going by the great reviews and was apprehensive about this after my sad experience at a guest-house in Bangkok, however, it turned out to be really good.  Checkin/Reception:  There was some confusion regarding the online booking initially, however, the reception staff were friendly and helpful and the checkin was smooth.  Room:  The room was big, clean and comfortable. The staff arranged for an extra bed too, which was nice and welcoming. The bathroom was also big and nicely done. The room had a TV, a set of table/chairs, a refrigerator and everything worked fine.  The biggest plus of the place is the location, which is Soi 10, next to the Jomiten beach. Infact, the road of the hotel has many budget hotels which are of great value.  Food:  We had our lunch at the restaurant below and the breakfast next day. Both were good and value for money. The food was nice and the restaurant service was good too.  Massage:  My parents got the Thai massage service at the hotel at 200 THB, which was good and relaxing.    Overall a great place to stay and value for money for the location bang next to the beach. Stefan's Guesthouse is a great place for vacation. Stefan and May owner and manager are very helpful. They give very good advise about Jomtien area. The staff were very helpful at the guesthouse. Stefan's has a great value for the money. I stayed there for 3 months December to February. The guest house offers day trips to nearby beaches about 2 times a week. I will visit there again I am sure. I would recommend Stefan's to family and friends who want a great place for a vacation. The location is very good foe Jomtien.  Charlie Found this after being overbooked in another guesthouse. We really glad we found it. We were made most welcome by friendly and caring staff. We were invited to their staff party, and treated like members of the family. Breakfast and dinner were excellent. Room was extremely nice with a balcony, and all this only two minutes away from the beach. We would definitely stay again. Very good value . Thank you for a very plesent stay.i was very happy with everything.the staff were very nice and helpfull.thanks to all of you.i would reconmend anyone to stay here.i will be back anytime i am visiting pattaya or jomtien We have stayed at Stefan's Guest House many times, the last time being June 2014, because it is great value for money, clean and with friendly and helpful staff. It is conveniently located for the beach/bars/shops of Jomtien. The rooms are simple but very comfortable and you have a choice of basic but good food for breakfast. Sometimes it is buffet and sometimes a la carte, depends on how busy it is. The restaurant also does snacks and evening meals which are good also. We go to play golf and the last time Stefan's arranged the golf and transport for us and the arrangements worked very well, so we will be requesting the same next time. Booking requests are dealt with promptly and efficiently and we have never had a problem, but always try to give as much notice as possible to make sure you can get in. We have used the massage services provided as well as pedicure/manicure in the beauty salon and these have always been very good. Wifi is available and internet service is free to guests. We are always very happy to go back knowing we will be well looked after. Regarding the questions asked as part of this report, it has to be remembered this is a guest house, not a hotel, so the ratings have been given with this in mind. i stayed at stefan's guesthouse again from nov 29 till dec 28 then came back feb 21 to feb 26 he keep my suitcase there while i was gone to phillipines on a visa run then he put the suitcase in my room when i returned also the boss lady bought me some thai desert i had been looking for, they do all the little things over and above, u must check this guesthouse out before u book anything else, book early because they are always full Firstly, after reading one of the reviews I really do wonder what some people expect in a guest house, it's not a ***** hotel, for the price of 500/600bht a night!    I've tried other places in this area but I decided Stefans is the place for me.    I always look at the room/sheets/bathroom in any hotel in Thailand before I accept them.    I've stayed here four times now and have not had any problems with the staff, they were all very helpful. Even though last time I'd forgotten to take my passport with me, they readily accepted my driving licence as ID.    The rooms were clean as were the sheets. The shower/toilet was clean, soap, towel etc. The water in the fridge still had the seals on.    We didn't eat here so I can't say what the food is like. Nor did I use the massage shop.    Situated in a quiet soi (4), a couple of bars across the road but no noise at night, our rooms were at the front facing the bars. There are many more bars in the next soi's up beach road (5/7/8/ soi White House)    Just a few minutes stroll to the beach, shops and caf√©'s along beach road.    Will definitely stay here again next time. one minute walk to beach with reasonably priced room. massage, hair dresser, manicure pedicure all attached. don't expect a lot of facilities in the room, normally serve a soap only but easy to buy tooth brush or shampoo as many 7/11 are in the area. breakfast is not bad ...buffet in high season and a la carte inlow season. please bring a copy of your passport if you do not want to wait too long. stefans guesthouse keeps getting better and better i have stayed here on vacation now for 6 years he continues to amaze me i was on a visa run to the Philippines for 2 weeks he stored my main suitcase and bag till i came back upon arrival back to his guest house he put my suitcase in the room and turned on the aircon so the room would be cold how many owner would do this he continue to amaze me i will return next year for another vacation don't miss this positive living experience if your looking for a room I have stayed in this place for one night. I will let you be the judge by describing my experience.  First of all, we spent 20 mintutes at the counter while the staff were teaching each other how to scan my passport (!) and issue a room key. To place you more into the atmosphere there are no air-cons or fans, just humidity. Secondly, after coming into the room I checked the bed sheets and they were all with BROWN (!) stains and some stains even from blue pens (?). The bathroom inspection showed that the ear buds bag was teared (!) and one was missing! To top things off, the bottled water in the refrigirator was missing a plastic security seal (!) and opened straight away- they were USED and RE-FILLED(!). In Thailand, water being so cheap and available in every single shop, this is an indiator that something is not right and it is probably tap water (your best bet). From the two available water bottles, they were both different types (!), both of which I never even heard of in my life (I have lived here for a long time).  And finally, in the morning staff started budging and knocking at our door at 12:20. Yes the check out time is 12:00, but after telling them we were on our way down they knocked again at 12:25 (!) with angry voices like we were some kind of intruders.  Downstairs, the owner, probably Stefan himself, with his wife and her bad english next to him, one by one,started lecturing on how he had customers waiting and how undispicable it was that we were not on time, and even insulted us by asking were we were from. I told him that most hotels give a 1 hour time frame to take care of guests who are a bit late with the check out to accomodate guest and got this reply- where did you hear this? Well my dear Stefan, I have been to over 50 countries and not a single hotel has given itself the scandalous and awful service as this one. Absolutely shocking, allround. Booked in for a few days and stayed longer. The room rate is reduced the longer you stay so if you think you will be there longer then say so.  Was shown two rooms, picked the larger one obviously. All very clean with all the usual facilities, en suite, tv, a/c and fridge. Safe tucked away in the wardrobe too.  Ate downstairs on a few occasions, both thai and western food, all good.  Friendly staff, always helpful with information or directions or getting the laundry done etc.  Quiet location on Soi 4 off the beach road, there are a couple of bars opposite that can be a bit noisy early in the evening but from my room at the rear I could not hear them, maybe if you have a balcony room it would be different. Short walk to the beach and everything else you need, bars, shops and restaurants.  10 minutes from Pattaya on the sawngthaew which will cost 10baht.  All in all a decent place to stay, would recommend. i have now stayed here for 90 days stefan has been very accommodating after 60 days i went to the phillipines for a visa run he stored my siutcase for 18 days then had my room ready when i arrived at 1 am he has 24 security he cleans my air con every month for me he goes out of his way to make you feel at home he also throws a christmas party for all his guest he has a great buffet from roast pig to smoked salmon with all the trimmings he also has santa claus give you a gift he thinks of all the little touches.i will be leaving again for the phillipines and he will store my stuff that i dont use the rooms are cleaned every day with new towels and sheets if needed for ant traveler that wants to stay long time he is willing to negotiate the price so you can work it in your budget if you decide to stay more than 30 days no balcony and no breakfast you can work out a very good price i highly recommend you check here first if your staying in jomtien or pattaya The location in soi 4 is good and the rates are reasonable. The premises are nicely styled in a Thai manner but the staff have forgotten about the land of smiles, and it is best to avoid the food. One of the few guesthouses with wifi in room, however. Stefan's itself is actually not a bad hotel but it seems the owners have believed their own hype and service has suffered.    Rooms are clean though and your valuables will be safe. Breakfast (1) included with each but woe betide you if you present your coupon at 1 minutes past 10 o clock - they will charge you for it.    Free internet but beware - you will get bitten by mosquitos while using their terminals.    Regrettably having stayed here in 2010 - I visited in 2011 and found the owner's wife most unhelpful despite her knowing I was a good customer. ""That was last year she said"" disdainfully.    Prices have gone up and there are far better options in the price bracket around there - though avoid the Moonshine as it is an absolute dump! Stefan's Guesthouse is in a calm area, but may be noisy at night from nearby bars. Staff, especially the manager, is not friendly and If you happen to to take a friend to your room, you will no longer be welcomed. So I checked out, Was easy to find a better choice with more value for money around.  If you like Jomtien with just beach, restaurants and some lower class bars, take a look at the many other guesthouses here. We stayed at the guesthouse for 3 weeks and the price / quality rating is just exellent :) For a budget hotel the service was great :) The staff was really friendly and helpful :) They also had their own massage parlor and a travel agency :) They were very professional :) The rooms were very spacious and cleaned daily :) All in all a very good hotel :) 24 hour reception . Cant fault this hotel ,staff realy make you feel at home ,good food ,great location ,lovely rooms ,will definately be back in the future ,thanks to stefan and all his staff , what really impressed me was the owner stefan ,he chatted to you just as if was just another guest absolutely lovely man.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.897133,100.869827&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.897133,100.869827|12.897133,100.869827&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.899167,100.867500|12.896080,100.869667|12.899475,100.867439|12.900520,100.868141|12.900580,100.868202|12.897475,100.868690|12.900520,100.868141&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.899569,100.866669|12.901288,100.869812|12.900651,100.869537|12.900101,100.868614|12.897036,100.868607|12.896251,100.869408|12.901025,100.869698|12.896970,100.871788|12.898400,100.872490&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.900978,100.868874|12.901440,100.869987|12.901156,100.869347|12.901293,100.868958|12.897312,100.871132|12.898083,100.868149|12.898530,100.868118|12.897419,100.870224&signature=KlX6GI12vqKfSneZoxtyXui-5jY=",1.0,Positive
32,SUKHOTAI RESORT PATTAYA - Prices & Lodge Reviews (Thailand),"Miss Kook and Miss Ninny as concierge very helpful to find information to buy Jade Statue Buddha.They search in internet again and again to find I need.  Finally find it near this hotel .  Thanks to them Due to a mis-booking, I was referred to a nearby hotel, the Suksubai Resort, Pattaya.    After arrival and during the check-in process, as per the norm, I enquired as to the price per night. The night manager flashed me a beaming smile and cordially informed me that it was 1300 THB for 2 nights.    Imagine my surprise when, the very same night manager asked me to pay the bill 12 hours in advance of my departure. Moreover, it had suddenly DOUBLED in price!    As usual, the poor Farang has to cough up and once again - another scammer wins, again. The same female colleague from the previous evening sat stony-faced next to him. I had the impression that she had seen this all before.    As for the premises themselves, there were hairs in the bath and dried urine on the toilet seat. The soles of my feet are black because quite obviously the floors have not been mopped out properly in a long time.    The ""breakfast"" was possibly the worst I have had in S.E. Asia. If you can manage to find a free seat amongst the hordes of Chinese tourists and do not expect a healthy, sustaining and tasty start to the day, this could be for you although I certainly wouldn't recommend it!    Stay away! Due to a mis-booking, I was referred to another hotel - the SUKSABAI RESIDENCE Pattaya.    Upon arrival and during the check-in process, as per normal, I enquired as to the nightly rate whereapon the night manager cordially informed me that it was 1300THB for 2 nights. I told him that I was happy with this price and he flashed me a beaming smile in return.    However, this evening, prior to check-out tomorrow morning, I was asked to settle the bill. Imagine my surprise when the aforementioned price suddenly DOUBLED! JUST LIKE THAT! The very same night manager simply multiplied 1 night's stay times 2 - BASTA!    Very good SCAM, I must say!    As for the premises itself, there were hairs in the bath and urine on the toilet seat. The ""breakfast""? Probably one of the worst I have ever had in S.E.Asia. Oh, beware of massive Chinese all-inclusive tours. If it's a quiet, relaxing and SUSTAINING breakfast your'e after, GO ELSEWHERE!    NEVER AGAIN! I recently returned from pattaya and and had booked suksabai again as this was my fourth time staying here but unfortunately this time was a unforgettable experience.  Arrived in morning after a 13 hr flt from London.Went to check-in at suksabai resort which it is now called.The lady said we have your room,it will cost you 2,000bht and not 1500bht.I showed her the email copy I received with the agreed price of 1500bht which they confirmed.  She then said we send you email with change of prices because new management now which I never received and when I asked her to show me copy of this on file,could not find.Her attitude was unbelievable,and you can only stay for 2 nights she said,as your room is booked after this.  I shall never return to this hotel again,i checked out after 1 night as I needed to sleep and found another hotel next day. Well i have stayed here for 2 night and my experience was very bad on first night but somehow managed. The hotel was running though a renovation stage so lot of dust around and there was a electricity issue on the first day which has caused lift not working and also Wi-Fi, Bathroom Gyser, Cable TV not working. We had reached at hotel at 3:00PM, after check-in when i asked about Lunch they told that cook is left for the day though somehow we manegd something outside. When we returned from sightseeing on evening at 8:00PM and asked for dinner the answer remain same from reception that cook has left for the day. The room was real good but that is only the possitive sight of that hotel apart from this i didn't see any good sight of the hotel nor even the location. The famous South Pattaya Beach and the Walking Street is far away from the hotel. Somebody must to hire Motorbike to reach there. They had provided complementary breakfast which was good. Because of service and the location i am giving average rating to this hotel. I am not going to choose this hotel, if i visit Pattaya next time. Looking for peacefull safe enviroment in hectic city? Suksabai can offer this base for family have a good time holiday in Pattaya. Room and facilities satisfied us 2 adult 2 kids living in one bedroom deluxe suite. Pricing of hotel, restaurant and services overall were reasonable. Owners are present everyday and they are interested about guests wellfare. We value this hotel something between 3 to 4 star experience. Only minus on our stay we consider was poor quality of breakfast. But in many cases and travellers breakfast its not the number one priority. Location is not center and/or beach, but rent a car or bike, you are 10-30min away from everywhere in Pattaya. I read that many had very good experience with Suksabai Residence. I guess mine was just ordinary and nothing much to be excited about.    I traveled with husband and my one and a half year old boy    We got checked into the 1st floor room. The recep could not find my booking initially. I booked through Expedia. Hence I suggest for travellers to confirm booking with the hotel after receiving confirmation from Expedia just to be sure. There was wifi in our room and it comes with a basic kitchenette.    The good-  Comfortable bed  Enough space in room  Private balcony  Good variety of channels on TV  Has a small baby pool    The downside (personal preference)  Bed is too high - dangerous for kid  No cot provided  Toilet shower area is very small with faulty door  Have to put on shoes when we use the balcony, would be better if they clean the floor  I read that the hotel is opened in 2012 but I find the room facilities quite old  Our sink in the toilet choked and they removed the sink stopper to allow water to flow faster  Staffs are not very friendly despite reading the other reviews.    Cant comment on food as our room does not come with breakfast and we didnt order any room service. It's pretty near to Outlet Mall, got a cab from hotel to send us there for 300 baht for 1 way. Hailing a cab from the roadside back to hotel was 150baht. But it's hard to get a taxi on the road, hence better to get hotel to get a taxi for you. But as expected they will charge you much higher than getting a taxi yourself.    I guess the better reviews came from travelers who stayed in the suites. My standard room was just as ordinary as it can be.    Will not be heading back to this hotel, I guess there are better choices in Pattaya I've lived in Thailand for 14yrs so I having a pretty good understanding of what is what and what to expect, on recommendation I booked a suit room on the 6th floor which without breakfast is 2700bht per night (expensive for Thailand), the suit was clean but for this price I certainly expected satellitetv and it only had cable which despite the 50"" lcd was a very low quality picture, the hotel had also just started some renovationswhen I checked in which woke me up early each morning and was going on all day. If you rent a suit you intend on spending time in it during the day as well as the night, giventhat Pattaya has just finished the rainy season and is now in high season this is notthe time to make renovations, the leather sofa in the suit lounge was the most uncomfortable I've ever sat on and there were no electric plug socets next to the bed for charging your cell phone and tablet and both the lounge and bedroom would have benefited from ceilng fans, I also put the 'make up room' sign on the suit door at 10am and on my return maybe 3hrs later my room hadn't been cleaned, very poor maid service. I was going to stay there again in March but I think I'll try somewhere else like maybe LK Metro. I have been here 3 times now and it still amazes me how they can make you feel so welcome and be so attentive even when their very busy.  The room and the pool are still top notch and the dinning room now serves Pizza in addition to a new comprehensive menu.  A complete joy to stay here as always I come at suksabai each year i think is one of the best hotel in pattaya. My room the suite is amazing so beautiful and confort and also all the staff is so gentle and avaible for all and the owner Bjorn is great!!! So i advice if u wanna have beautiful holiday to come at suksabai residence the best hotel in pattaya!!!    Andrea Costa We spent 4 nights and had a great time. Room was comfortable and well furnished. Missing a couple of small niceties, but easy to get by without them.The food at the restaurant was great and had a wide variety of Western and Thai foods. My wife loved the Cocktails. The staff were friendly and willing to help with everything. The boss was a lovely lady who made sure we got well looked after and everything we needed. A little out of the way of things, but that made it quieter than a lot of other motels and we had the motel vehicle as a taxi whenever we needed it. We will definitely go back. Thank you to all the staff for a great stay! This was the second time I stayed in the VIP room at Suksabai and I highly recommend it. Its only 5 mins from the beach and its quiet enough at night to get a good nights sleep. Very comfortable beds! I recommend suksabai residence,I was there for 3 weeks,the staff was very friendly and helpfull as we changed room 3 times they said ok with no problems,reason for changing rooms was the shower water took a long time to go down,first two rooms we had same problem,3rd time lucky was excellent room ty suksabai and staff and owners,my daughter loved the pool,clean and plenty of western and thai food,loved it....... The best part of this hotel is the room. Comfortable with all amenities you'd need. Private balcony ensures a sit out in the evenings in case you don't wish to venture out. Just that the air conditioning unit could have been a bit higher in the balcony to avoid hot air being blown put in your face. Did not like the small, dingy bathroom.    Courteous staff. Small but excellent pool. Location wise it is a bit far from 2nd road and beach road which means you spend a lot commuting. But I think it's covered by the fact that the prices are very pocket friendly here without the compromise of quality. A very large night market takes place like 10 min walk from the hotel. Local restaurants, super marts & pubs can be found 5 min walk from the hotel. They even assist you in hiring motor bikes & cars in case.    Finding it is a bit tricky as locals say ... ""awwww there are a lot of suksabai's..."" take the address preferably in Thai when you go out to return late evening. Just came back from Pattaya after a 3 nights stay at Suksabai Residence.    I really liked the room, the amenities such as the nice and refreshing swimming pool and the result of the cleaning personell. Even the food, was it Thai or International was very acceptable such as the prices asked for that.    One thing what I did not like at all was the No-smoking policy. I booked a smoking room, I received a reconfirmation but when I entered the room there was this 5000 THB fine leaflet.  I talked to the reception, they did refuse to return my total payment as well as they could not give me my smoking room.    This is for me inacceptable and will be the big hint for the next booking at this Hotel. I stayed at Suksabai Residence when it opened in December 2012 for 2 nights and again in October 2013 for almost 3 weeks in the period from September 29th to October 17th. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay there in a very comfortable and cosy room. Everything exceeded my expectations, from the quality of the facilities to the service and attitude of the staff. The hotel is in a relaxed area and not far from the beautiful beach of Jomtien. I really felt at home, in a secure and good ambience facilities.I highly recommend staying at Suksabai Residence and plan on staying there again in the foreseeable future with my kids. Just come back from pattaya and once again had a wonderful stay at suksabai,staff were so friendly and so helpful with any queries I had,beautiful suite room on 6th floor with view of jomtien,great location,nice and quiet,good security,reasonably priced for such a beautiful room and yet only 10 mins to jomtien and 15 mins into pattaya.will be back again later this year for my 3rd stay there. I am really happy after i staying this place last december 4th-28th 2013.good service and Food . staff so kind, always helping.And the owner couple so servicemindet,they also make airport pick up and delevry.i will now after 2 mounths going back whit my friend. I stayed at this hotel for 1 month , I confess that I was a little worried because for the first time I was traveling with his wife and daughter only 10 months old , but since our arrival we felt good immediately , in the living room had a large sofa and a LCD TV with home theater system , the kitchen was stocked with large refrigerator, microwave, 2 ring cookers and a nice table , the bedroom was large and confortable and also with an LCD TV, the bathroom was large with a jacuzzi. We asked for a little bed for the baby that was immediately provided with the payment of a small fee. Sometimes we had dinner in the room and I have to say that the service was fast and friendly . The pool is not huge but it is more than enough for a hotel with about 60 rooms , however it was clean and it was too important for my daughter , it was also possible to eat at the pool. The distance from the center of pattaya is only a 20 minute walk away but for those who do not want to walk there is a taxi service that a couple of times a day is free. It remains only to thank everyone from Bjorn and his wife Toy until Mokol and Sek and all the guys at the front desk and security with which I must apologize for not leaving a tip for a little misunderstanding . We'll see you next year ! No wifi ...telephone machine was not provided...we requested couple of times but no reponse....no locker facility....Very poor room service ...one of worst hotels we stayed in pattaya....while booking the room it was clearly mentioned breakfast was included , but they rejected the same once we reached there. I stayed here for three weeks during the peak season and intend to return upon my next visit to Pattaya. The staff are all very friendly and most speak passable English with some being nearly fluent. The rooms are sparkling, are cleaned daily (as long as you don't sleep all afternoon) and though I didn't make much use of the LCD TV or microwave I did appreciate the choice of a hot shower and full size fridge. Hotel security is robust; they will never let anyone pass reception without your prior sanction. It's also worth mentioning that I never used the safe once and I left my laptop on the desk in my room for the whole stay. While the distance to the main hotspots in central Pattaya may not suit everyone it gave me the excuse to jump on the back of a bike taxi at every opportunity and the location does offer some respite from the non-stop activity down Walking Street, Beach Road and Soi 6. There is also some local entertainment just a few hundred metres from the hotel that is worth sampling. If I had to say what I liked the least it would probably be that the Bar was only installing a pool table on the day I was leaving, otherwise I'd probably have spent some more time there. The check in process took more than 3/4 of an hour. There was no other customers at reception. We booked 2 rooms. We were allocated two rooms next to reception and it was very noisy. The rooms are new but the bathroom is not well cleaned. The rooms had a general unpleasant horrible odour (drainage problem). There were 7 people(us counted!) at reception at any given time. Most just stood around with the manager allocating rooms etc. On expressing our disgust at the odour, they sprayed the rooms saying there were no other rooms available. In one of the rooms, telephone and bedside table was missing. An old dusty telephone was installed upon request. The hotel itself is away from any happenning spots but shuttle service(free) is advertised on the internet. On the night of check in the driver dropped us to requested marketplace with reluctance.  The next day, we walked across open drains and makeshift kitchen to their dining area for breakfast. Apart from the hot dishes, the flies seem to be resident on all other dishes especially the fruit platter(could have been easily remedied with a cover). The hot dishes were good and the cook and his assistant(the short one) were the only people attempting to provide some sort of service.  The hotel has a swimming pool whereupon my husband was regarded with suspicion when he was swimming! The second day some people were enjoying with drinks by the poolside. After spending the first night at the hotel and staying in our room(no facilities), we asked the hotel to drop us at central festival, we were asked to wait even though the hotel had shown us a sign which clearly stated that the shuttle made 2 trips to Jomtein beach and central festival at 11am and 4pm.(deviation from website advertisement).  The next day, after staying in our room for the whole day, and telling reception we would like to be dropped at central festival at 4, we were asked by Riza (at reception) whether we would like shuttle surcharge to pay upfront or put on our room. She was appallingly rude. We pointed out that this was a free service advertised. She said if we expected service we should go to 5 star hotel. After a few heated words at discrepancies, she ran off screaming with the shuttle driver hiding in the next room.  The manager tried to explain, saying the surcharge is because of high season. We said we want to check out as suggested by Riza. We did, got them to call Agoda to refund our money. Agoda still hasn't refunded the new year's surcharge they still keeping. Lucky for us we moved to a fantastic hotel from there!!  Everything seemed like a huge problem and definately not a family hotel. I would never this hotel to anyone. Absolute shambles! Had a months stay in thes new hotel/serviced apartment and was fantastic. From the brand new rooms with not just one but two Sony flat screen TV's in the living room (with Sony home entertainment system and DVD player) and one in the bedroom. Jazzucci in the bathroom and beautifull bedrooms. Has a great pool and spotlessly clean and a bar and restaurant with great and reasonably priced food... Well located in a nice quiet area just 50yds of one of the main streets..... but a special mention to the staff, especially the management. I arrived with a minor problem with my booking, which was the fault of the company we booked through and she sorted it out with no problem and went that extra mile to make sure we were absoluctly happy.. So thanks to her and the rest of the staff and owner of this fantastic residence... Will return and would highly recommend.... This lovely new hotel in Jomtiem as great rooms, charming staff, many lovely suites with all the mod cons you could wish for including 50meg broadband. Nice swimming pool with shading, and in house transport to take you to and pick you up when ever. I recently spend 3 weeks at suksabai residence,wonderful stay in the 1 bedroom suite,all new,comfortable bed,2 large screen tv,s, great bathroom with jazzucci,beautiful pool ,staff were excellent,location is great,nice and quiet but only 10 mins to jomtien and 15 to intown pattaya,definitely recommend this place and will return again.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.907640,100.882263&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.907640,100.882263&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.906674,100.877853|12.908383,100.892921|12.905225,100.877312|12.905161,100.882828|12.906600,100.878822|12.905026,100.877380|12.907640,100.882263|12.905974,100.882736|12.908949,100.891106&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.913368,100.873314|12.905355,100.873077|12.915799,100.886353|12.911740,100.880096|12.916827,100.879189|12.910579,100.873123|12.906291,100.876801|12.911975,100.880020|12.910710,100.872566&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.910244,100.874542|12.910260,100.874184|12.901575,100.873116|12.900847,100.874405|12.910868,100.872353|12.902781,100.874138|12.912800,100.873619|12.908669,100.881470|12.901670,100.873016&signature=Ds2kYNGU8Re7LWNuAhJ9dDjEx_Y=",0.9999,Positive
33,"SUTUS COURT 2 - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","Booked with Orbitz .com-- check in easy, room ready. We were on 2nd floor- 2 rooms. King bet, air, reasonable size, toilet good, tv, wi fi, balcony with no view. Overall room was good for price but at night noisy from activities in the soi. The swimming pool was great, Room servicing was good. Photos on internet are a little outdated. Room rate around 25 australian dollars per night. There are better rooms than the ones we had. Location is good for action seekers. The Sutus Court complex is in an excellent location if you like good cheap restaurants, plenty of places for a drink, easy access to transport and a short walk to the beach.  The check-in process was fine but that was about it. I was given a room on the 4th floor,which was fine to try and cut down on road noise, but no-one mentioned there's no elevator in that building,so me and the hotel employee had to carry the bags up several flights of stairs. We got to a room that was literally right under the roof.That is, the ceiling had a slope on it which meant things like using the mirror were impossible and it was a bit of a contortion to use the toilet.  The room itself had dated 70's decor, though the toilet had been replaced. There was no soap holder, the TV was new 20 years ago, the internet didn't work for a full day and neither did the phone when I rang up to ask about the internet! To cap it off,there were ants..... lots and lots of ants so putting rubbish into the smallest rubbish bin in Thailand was an excuse for the ants to come and visit.  I will use this complex again for all the reasons mentioned but will not use this hotel. It was a disappointing stay. Clean room and convenient location with 7 eleven, family mart, eateries, pubs, massage parlours all within walking distance. Towels are provided, refrigerator but no bath room kits. Bring your own.  Overall it is a pleasant stay for the amount we pay, it is worth it/ Good location, close to pubs, bars, shops and market, 10-15 mins by foot to get to Walking street. Great value for money and even if the building is a bit old, it was clean. Loved the swimming pools and we enjoyed our stay here. This hotel offers customers a great choice from their larger roomed Sutus Court 1 to the lower priced but smaller units all located in adjacent buildings around the communal pool and car park.  This time, I stayed in Sutus Court 2 which is the second most expensive rooms they have available. Still good value though.  Approached through SC1 over a flat roof with pretty steep ramps which are very slippery when wet, pass the inviting jacuzzi and you are in your allocated room.  It does offer all the usual facilities but to be honest, they are tired and outdated and could do with replacement. That said, you get what you pay for and this option is both cheap and more than adequate for a few nights stay.    The Sutus Court buildings are well located on Buakhao with great restaurants on your doorstep. There is a decent sized car park although this can get full, pleasant enough staff except at night when they get out the grumpy versions and an acceptable coffee shop which all feature the statutory old experts on everything that is wrong with Thailand - You have met them!  All in all, this is a decent place to park your head during your trip to Pattaya. I have stayed in 1,2 and 4 Sutus Court No 1 to many bagging doors. Sutus Court 2 is my Favorite quiet no bagging doors cost less than 1, Sutus court 4 very quiet if you like that it's away from everything. Staff are very good safety deposit boxes available just basic place to stay clean rooms Air Con for the price it OK I've stayed here several times in Sutus 1,2 and 5 all rooms were clean with good air con and fan , tv , free wifi and good bathrooms .  Although some of the rooms may not be the most modern I think that reflects on the price .  On first floor they have quite A big jacuzzi and on ground floor big pool both are well kept and clean .  I noticed during my stay the staff come out at about 5 am and everything is cleaned and brushed floors , chairs ,tables and pathways .......spotless  Also has ample free parking for residents which is good in that area !  I will stay again on my next visit Room towel is old and dirty and unfriendly staff. However the location is very convenient to a night life a lot of bars around the area and walk 30 minutes to the pier station.    Swimming are good but not really clean. It was my first time in Pattaya.  I booked this hotel for 5 nights.  I didnt know where I was going.    Despite of this hotel has got just one star., i spent a nice time in this hotel.    All is clean. Maybe they need to be renovated .but bed was good. And my opinion is the follow.. if U sleep well holiday are good.    Swimming is very good. Just tipy that dont have more place at the pool and something to be protect of the sun.    Hotel is not far away from everything.    Hotel can arrange U excursion with good price.    Please note that in case of you broke a glass, a bridge , mirror , U should paid.... I like Sutus court 2, I made the mistake of upgrading to Sutus court 1, it was very noise and people banging doors at all hour, because it has an in closed hall way you hear every sound, I will go back to Sutus court 2 as there is none of that there. this is a collection of buildings 1,2,3 priced for the tourist market room was ok hot water and pressure good.front desk staff were helpful and seemed like their job would stay here again. hotel had two pools outside Booked with Orbitz .com-- check in easy, room ready.

34,"SWISS PARADISE BOUTIQUE VILLA - Prices & Lodge Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","We stayed in this villa on 25th to 28th Nov as a couple. We had room 303.    Overall we had a lovely time here, we will definitely stay again. We cannot fault one bit of this place, everything works, everything was pleasant, we were very comfortable, relaxed and felt welcome and at home. There was this atmosphere in the villa that the owners have where you just feel belonged and welcomed. If you like personal touch type of stay, defo recommend this! We have listed specific things we wanna share we very much liked in the place:    Fantastic Staff/services.  Hans the owner, his wife and the rest of the staff had provided us 5-star treatment and services. Example, we had ordered food from grab. It was so easy and we just asked them to receive and pay it for us (left money with them). Another was cleaning the room, whatever time, that suits us, we always come back with made up room, thoroughly cleaned too.    Excellent food.  My wife‚Äôs favourite is the Greek salad and the Swiss style sausage yum yum! They would serve us breakfast even though it was past 11am. Reasonably priced breakfast/ drinks. We came back after a day‚Äôs stroll when everything shuts, Hans served us beer and sat down with the other guests for a night cap. This was lovely.    Convenient location.  We drove here and found easy parking (on the road) next to the villa. It is walking distance to the beach, food places. There is a massage (Savanna) nearby. Close to family mart too.    Relaxing clean pool.  We spent a lot of time in the pool, when we came, it was quiet and we had the pool to ourselves (usually hang around midday until early afternoon). Staff were always available to take drink orders or food.    Other services.  We had asked them for laundry, they charge per item. Again, this was hassle free. We just left clothes at the front desk, and they brought it to the room, hung and nicely folded in the cupboards.    Thank you everyone at Swiss Paradise Boutique villa! You made our stay in Pattaya very comfortable and relaxing! I visited the Swiss Paradise many times and in this case the high rating is really justified. At a crazy and often loud and dirty city Hans and his wife created a small but lovely hideaway. The hotel is located 400 meters from the bus service that brings you for 10 baht to the city. It‚Äôs not in the middle of town but close to a nice beach, if the word nice is trustworthy in Pattaya. The rooms are the cleanest I ever saw and walking bare feet through the hotel did not leave any dust on my feet. As other reviews already mentioned you find a big refrigerator, good beds, nice balconies, clean bathrooms with good showers and friendly stuff that proves that this is a place of respect and friendliness. It is a statement for the real Thailand me and my family love since decades. You will not find a fitness or a big restaurant but this easy to be found in the area around the hotel. The only negative point about die Swiss Paradies is that you have to leave one day. But you might come back one day! It was ineed a pleasure to stay at this cozy hotel for a couple of nights. The Wongamat beach is just 5 minutes walk and many shops nearby too.  Terminal 21 would be not that walkable distance specially in the hot climate.  Rooms in the Hotel are very well decoated, neat and clean place. My room had balcony overlooking the swimming pool. Pool had lots of plants and a couple of trees around it, breakfast was not included in the room rate, but can be arranged for a small charge.  The family who owned the hotel are very experienced in running the hotel. By all counts, it was a pleasant experience to be in this hotel. Recently I stayed a week in Swiss Paradise Boutique Villa. This was my second stay. Located in a quiet area in Naklua, not far from Dolphin roundabout and Terminal 21 shopping centre. Bath bus is 3/4 minutes walking distance. 24 hour Family Mart round the corner.  What a lovely hotel run by Swiss Thai couple. The host were very friendly and helpful as always. Highly clean room overlooking the swimming pool. Because it is a small hotel, I felt homely. Most of the time I was the only one in the swimming pool to enjoy!  I would give 10 out of 10 for this fantastic hotel. I loved my time staying at Swiss Paradise Villa in Pattaya, the hotel is in a quiet soi in North Pattaya bars restaurants shop's beach are all within walking distance. The owners are very friendly and helpful they arranged many motorbike taxi's for me for many dental appointments in South Pattaya, the hotel it's self has nice rooms good wifi excellent housekeeping a nice little pool area, when I return later this year swiss paradise will be my first choice, highly recommended We stayed for 7 days at the Swiss Paradise Boutique Hotel during the last week of January 2018  The overall experience was excellent and I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending this hotel ...  Hans, his wife and the very pleasant lady who cleaned and looked after the rooms were the perfect hosts ... thank you  The hotel is situated to the North of Pattaya a quiet area which is well served by a very frequent bus service only a short walk from the hotel ... the beach is a pleasant 10 minute walk with supermarkets very nearby  Just a couple of things that would of made things perfect for us is:  1. A soap dispenser or soap tablet near the sink in the bathroom ... if you want to wash your hands you have to walk into the shower area to get the soap ... not so good if you are dressed ready to go out and the shower area is still wet on the floor ...  2. Tea/coffee facility in the room  Overall though this is a superb place to stay ... and thoroughly recommend booking Thank you Hans The owners went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. The rooms are well maintained with a huge shower area. They phoned taxis and the opened backed truck for us, getting us a better price than if we has done it ourselves. They recommended a Thai place within walking distance which my daughter and I enjoyed.  We were catching a plane home after leaving Swiss Paradise and they said we could stay until we were ready to leave for the airport, that was a great bonus. After our walk to and from the Sanctuary of truth it was great to be able to have a shower before our long flight home. Thank-you. Modern 5Star decor with a Villa concept. For a moment I forgot I was in Pattaya! Property was so tranquil, lots of greens and plants, crisp and fresh environment makes it the No.1 choice for a relaxing getaway. Upon entering the premise, instantly felt how much hard work has been put in to maintain such high standard of living. Believe all the good reviews that has been written here because they are exactly what Swiss Paradise Villa offers to their guests. The immaculate clean rooms, food cook-to-order with love and staffs/owner 's hospitality deserves a perfect 10/10 rating. Without a doubt, I'll stay here again and again and again!  Million thanks for providing me & all travellers a luxurious home in the small town of Pattaya. It was very good experience for me and my wife in this hotel. The room was spacious clean and quiet. The manager, Hans was very kind and always ready to give help all day long. If I visit Pattaya again I would stay here without any hesitation. This is by far the best hotel in Pattaya! Every detail considered and done well. I truly felt at home. The owners were incredibly helpful, and more than accommodating with our excursions and with arranging transport. Whenever we arrived we received a very warm welcome. The location is perfect in a quiet neighborhood in walking distance to the beach and other shops. And it gets even better... the food prepared at Swiss Paradise was amazing! Cheers to the Chef and Owner I cannot recommend Swiss Paradise highly enough! This is an absolutely extraordinary hotel. I look forward to my next stay. We had a lovely longer stay at Swiss Paradise in January-February, 2017. You could name it Sweet Paradise - such a lovely family owned place to stay. Located in a quiet area, however it took only a few minutes walk to the main street and take baht taxi (10 baht) to the center. Villa is clean and what really mattered: shower and toilet were clean and worked very well. Pick up from and to the AirPort was arranged. Last but not least: Hans, his wife Daeng and maid Tschuen are super friendly, lovely and welcoming - couldn't wish more - we felt at home :)    Eija & Keimo, Helsinki, Finland I really enjoyed my weekend stay at Swiss Paradise Boutique Villa. It is located in a very quiet neighborhood yet walking distance to main attractions in the north beach area.  It is a clean and charming boutique hotel with a very welcoming owner and staff. The room is exceptionally clean and bed is very comfortable, nicely decorated with matching furnitures with safe. Your own balcony is the nice place to sit and relax with fresh air beside hanging your wet swimwear.  I especially enjoyed talking with an owner during my stay. He shared his story of his life-long experiences in the hospitality business and that is what you do see and feel everywhere in this hotel. ""We offer Swiss management and Thai hospitality"" was the perfect fit to explain this lovely hotel. Thanks for helping me to get show ticket and reach to places. I really enjoyed talking with you and staying here.    I highly recommend this charming hotel and I hope if I could come back some day. A marvellous hotel. Every single detail was considered, beautiful tasteful large rooms. We had a balcony overlooking the pool. Lovely small pool in well maintained garden. The owners were incredibly helpful, and arranged transport for us and gave a very thorough introduction to the workings of the hotel and room. Also pointed out local amenities. We arrived later than expected and received a very warm welcome. They also gave us their contact numbers in case of any problems. For the price this place was amazing. I cannot recommend it highly enough. We hade a wonderful time with some friends, we will back soon . We love to stay in the area , it's easy to get around because the traffic is not to busy . next year we will back . THanks for everything I was looking for pricy hotel in Pattaya. I was keep looking and looking and found one. It was this hotel. It is not on the Walking street, so i hesitated... Cause i dont want the hotel to be too far from the main attractions.    Got to to the hotel. No more worries.  You can take Pattaya taxi(sungtaou?) from the bus terminal and get off. It only takes 10 to 15 mins.  When you go to the Walking street you can also take the public taxi cross the street. Takes no more than 20 mins. You can also walk to the beach.    It was just perfect hotel. Very clean. White floor with no single dirt. No water mold in the toilet. The staffs were super kind and helpful. Swimming pool was cosy and feel like my private swimming pool. The neighbor hood was peaceful. Not noisy at all. 5 star accommodation 5 star Owner and family.. 5 star staff cannot fault this place absolutely perfect place to stay will be back very soon ...this place has got to be the best and most accommodating and friendly places to stay in all off pattaya recommend it .I have stayed hotels all over the world past 35 years and this place as small as it is has got to be up there with the best ..Antony.. Located in North Pattaya; the property is a private villa owned and managed by a couple;they are very polite and friendly, liked their hospitality ..the breakfast was good property is not a big hotel but small and cozy place to stay for day or two if you arent willing to spend much on stay. rooms were properly lit, washroom were clean. overall a good experience. situated in north pattaya a 10 mins drive from the main pattaya. We enjoyed a short stay at this wonderful guesthouse. The property is in a quiet neighborhood about 200m from the main road. This ensures a good night of sleep.    The rooms are modern and super clean, and have balconies facing the pool. Air-conditioning works very well. Beds are super comfortable.    Owner Hans was very helpful, recommending places to go (secluded Bamboo Beach is fantastic!) and even driving is to a restaurant with his own car.    Prices are very moderate. I look forward to staying at this guesthouse again, and I highly recommend to everyone that looks for a home away from home in Pattaya. we have spent 3 nights on march 2016 in this guesthouse  inice room and swimming pool  but too moise by night with a lot of dogs around they scream  breakfast very poor all time same thing  and if u dont like salt u have just 2 toasts  if u ask onre coffee outsiode breakfast u have to pay 45 bhats it is too expensive for small guesthouse  and it is a little far from main road  it is too expensive for benefits My Thai spouse and I lodged 3 weeks during the high season in the nice Swiss Paradise Hotel. ""Herr Hans"" the manager and his lovely wife exploit the family hotel in a professional way. All staff are super friendly, professional and very helpful. The all-in hotel (comfortable rooms, bar, dining hall en swimming pool area) is super clean. And the hotel is located in a quieter area, with easy access to whatever you like to visit.  In the SWISS Paradise you really get value for money. Modest prices are offered.  I highly recommend this super nice family hotel to whoever wants to escape from some overcrowded and noisy locations in Pattaya.  We will return to this hotel during our next stay in Pattaya. My wife and I stayed 6 Nights in this Hotel.    Swiss Paradise Villa is in north Pattaya, off Pattaya-Naklua Road, in a quite Suburb.    The night live along Naklua Road is only about 10 Min walk away.  Pattaya Beach and City Center is a short Taxi ride away and cost only 10 Bath per person.    The Hotel is new and has 12 nicely decorated Rooms with big beds and all the comfort you need for a relaxing holiday.  The Rooms are big and very clean.    The Bangkok Airport transfer organised by the Hotel was perfect!    Swiss Paradise Villa is owned and managed by Hans Banziger, a Swiss National and his lovely Thai wife Daeng and son James.    Highly Recommended to stay in this Hotel.  Value for your money! My Thai wife and I (German) spent some weeks for the second time in this new villa    Room size is adequate, clean and well equipped    Landlords (Swiss and Thai) make your stay feeling you at home    Quiet location off busy Naklua Street    We go to Pattaya to play golf and this is a perfect place to stay    Good value for money    Waraporn and Stefan We have stayed a few times in this Boutique hotel during our trips to Pattaya.  Hans and his wife are absolutely lovely and have make us feel like at home from the first day.  It's amazing to find a so quiet and peaceful place at only 5 minutes (by motobike or taxi) from Pattaya city center.  The little swimming pool is surrounded by plants and flowers (a lot of orchidees) that Hans waters carefully everyday. The hotel is new and clean, a good value for money ! This is an excellent small family run hotel where the rooms are absolutely first class and the service excellent. I am a very experienced world traveller and I rate this as one of the best places to stay. Jim Holloway This newly opened place has deserved its name: it IS a true ""Paradise Boutique Villa"". You encounter a fresh and custom made building with somewhat 20 rooms or so, a tastefully fashioned little pool area and garden and all set up in a quiet neighborhood but not far away from Naklua Road where transportation to all the hot and less so spots is easily available.  But this Swiss run ""Paradise Boutique Villa"" not only captivates through its modern standard, the well-appointed rooms and in-room amenities: it is also a good value for the room rate asked. The general areas, too, are tastefully furbished in every detail with a lot of plants and nice little odds and ends everywhere again proving the premises' name. And finally: the owner-landlord looks pleasantly but unobtrusively after his guests: you can enjoy yourself there very well as a couple, as a family and certainly also as a solo traveler. Booked by a friend who lives in Pattaya we were most curious to arrive at the Swiss Paradise. And we were impressed by this smallish hotel run by a Swiss. Rooms were spacious and well equipped, WiFi worked fast which is certainly not always the case in Thailand and the whole place was clean and tidy - the Swiss way. Its not far to walk to Pattaya - Nakluea Rd. where you get public transport. Highly recommended! stayed at swiss paradise for 7 nights 18th to 24th august 2012. booked 2 bungalows, very good rooms, good cleaning staff, very friendly owner Hans who provided us with info on our further travels.The Thai girls stayed with us were treated with respect, unlike other hotels i have stayed in. would recommend to those who enjoy Pattaya in a quiet location, with easy access to all the action Pattaya has to offer. will stay there again. 2nd trip to Pattaya, lucky to find small section of tranquility in a very built up area. Warm welcome from Hans on arrival,all staff extremely friendly. Pool & gardens lovely for relaxing. Food is excellent you must also try the restaurant evening menu everything sumptuous. Stayed longer than originally booked then travelled to Koh Samet & Koh Chang. Would absolutely stay here again if going to Pattaya. Thank you Hans.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.958015,100.888489&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.958015,100.888489|12.958015,100.888489&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.958720,100.886070|12.959459,100.886894|12.957578,100.888878|12.956059,100.889862|12.958417,100.885742&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.955278,100.890602|12.958667,100.884949|12.958895,100.885231|12.957106,100.891983|12.956288,100.889046|12.958258,100.889267|12.955101,100.890587|12.958486,100.888756|12.958459,100.892700&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.958800,100.885796|12.959042,100.887306|12.953860,100.887932|12.959659,100.887077|12.956101,100.887009|12.960558,100.887566|12.959488,100.889458|12.957663,100.888779&signature=1bhT9Lh4oJJdOUqPfrLHWDuhtdk=",1.0,Positive
35,THE A.A. PATTAYA RESIDENCE $24 ($Ã∂4Ã∂9Ã∂) - Prices & Inn Reviews - Thailand - Tripadvisor,"Old hotel with no amenities. They charged us for drinks we never took from the bar. We couldn't do anything as we were unable to explain them. They just said it's missing from the fridge.    Coming to the room, it was decent room close to the beach and restaurants. We didn't get any thing except the room. We asked for electronic kettle but they provided hot water. The hotel is very run down the staff is over friendly and there is no breakfast or dinner its a shame as it's in a good location but needs lots of work would go to dynasty inn next time cost a bit more but lot better hotel A great budget hotel close to the beach and a short distance from Walking Street. Everyone was really helpful and the lady in charge of the breakfast buffet was amazingly kind. Spacious comfortable rooms and bathrooms. Good pool and free Wi-fi. Hotel is very average. Furnitures and bathroom equipments are very old. It seems people come here only for availing massage service because as soon as you enter the hotel the reception staff guides you to take their massage service. Location of the hotel is good. Nearby walking street, ripleys and night market. Good indian restaurants are there for indian food lovers. Staff is helpful. I spent 5 nights at this hotel & I found it a pleasant place to stay. The location is in a good spot in central Pattaya & only about 2 minutes walking distance from the beach    My room was spacious & the bed was comfortable & I chose a cheaper room with no view but it was fine. The staff at the reception & the porter lads were really friendly.    There is a rooftop pool that also serves food & a buffet breakfast on offer which is value for money as it is cheap especially compared to nearby cafes etc. Wasn't my first choice, but in the end I enjoyed my stay. The hotel is located close to the walking street, and close to the beach front area. TV had English movie channel, room was clean. $1000 baht per night, on par with other hotels I checked in the area. Bottled water in room is not free, $15 baht/bottle. Would I stay here again, yea sure. I was tipped off about this little gem by a friend, as he said it was cheap friendly and good fun...... He wasn't lying perfect place to stay on a budget not loud outside even though your a 5 min walk from the local nightlife. Really enjoyed my stay will be back for sure. The cleaning crew are thieves. Stole my just purchased Dr. Dre headset for over $100.  I used them the night before, put it in the backpack's side pocket. having had the room cleaned, the earbuds were stolen. the side pocket was wide open. There was no one in the room the night before and i used the item.  The front desk refused to provide the manager's info whatsoever.  These criminals must be caught. I suggest to bring a wireless video register or better yet stay far far away if you want your belongings safe. The hotel it self is ok. But for 1000 bath you could easily get better value for money. The rooms are old but good enough cause it is quiet. No bars you could hear noise from.The wifi is no good, it falls out all the time. The staff is all right but not the cleaning lady cause she steals from your wallet in pocket. Also I see that she wash the room at one time, and many hours later she unlocks her self in to the room, to fill up 2 bottles in the minibar. Unlucky for her I was at the room then. But the staff wont do anything about the stealing of money from the room. They just say that one should use the safety box they have downstairs. Stay away if you dont like thieves. When we arrived the hotel we were greeted by a pleasant but somewhat aloof staff. This remained so throughout our stay. I felt that maybe they were a little wary of possible complaints. Perhaps not without reason.    The lobby of the AA Hotel are large and well kept. Nostalgic interior and furnishings may be associated with an older fashionable hotel. And this increases the expectation of what will meet you when you arrive your hotel room.    But do not be fooled. The best one can say about the room was that the bed was big and good, with clean bedding. The interior in general, that were painted in a light beige color, did not seem to gotten a lick of paint since it was painted first, obviously many years ago.    The worst however was the bathroom. There was hot water in both the wash basin and the shower, at least for a while. Towards the end of the stay much of the hot water disappeared. The water pressure in the shower was ok. But when we arrived there was a heavy leak in the shower handle so you had to keep a hard grip on it to prevent the water to splash everywhere else than where it was supposed to go. Credit to staff though to fix this with a new shower handle the day after, when we pointed out the problem. But otherwise the bathroom was full of mold, and they had tried to hide the old mold by painting over the joints with white paint, which had run down the tiles, the bath and floor tiles. It needs a real upgrade.    Here you get no shampoo, shower cap, cotton buds etc. What you get is two of the little soap pieces one remember from 40-50 years ago.    The room is equipped with an old tube TV. There are some twenty channels with very variable picture quality. The room also has a mini bar in a well-used refrigerator. As if the whole offer was not sparse enough, they require 15 thb for a bottle of water. I can not remember having been in a hotel where two bottles of water a day were not included.    AC at the highest setting was barely strong enough to keep the temperature low enough.    The price for the room only was 1,000 thb. We did not try the breakfast, but according to previous reviews this is not a great experience.    The best one can say about AA Hotel's is good location and the swimming pool area on the fourth floor.    One will definitely be able to find better offers for the same or lower price in this area. First of all, I have to say that I had total different expectation from Pattaya. It's a hot/humid beach city (not a small town but a city). There is no wind which makes the humidity unbearable, no waves at sea, and the beach water and sand is small and filthy. From morning till night there are hundreds, up to about a thousand of prostitutes wondering the beach boulevard. Not a safe place at night.    The AA hotel staff was great. Friendly, accomodating, and always willing to help out. The hotel property itseld if completely outdated and badly maintained. Swimming pool has missing tiles, risking to cut open your skin. The bedroom in general has been constructed very poorly, making it impossible for housekeeping ladies to maintain hygiene standards. Furniture dates back from the 80's?    I was planning to stay at least a week at this beach side resort, I left for the airport after 2 nights. Never again. Will never recommend it to anybody. stayes in June, nice and friendly Filipino staff, rooms were ok size, furniture old and bathroom old, bedding and towels were always clean when changed, air-con in my room worked well. good location right on the beach (this is the AA Pattaya hotel not the Residence. did not list the one on the beach road) I was starting the get used to the place untill my final 2 days when i started to spot some cockroaches scrambling around when i put the bathroom light on, not a good sign, but you eventually get what you pay for, 1000baht per night, what this hotel has going for itself is the staff, location,and pool with balcony overlooking the beach. We stayed at the AA pattaya hotel just down the soi from the AA pattaya residence would not recommend this hotel very outdated would not say its a two star hotel stayed in much better places for far less money room is bog standared broken shower curtain no free water no soap or anything in bathroom pool area was not cleaned in the two days we stayed there empty beer bottles were still there the next night overflowing ashtrays am a smoker myself but these ashtrays had not been emptyed in a long time only good point is the view from the pool to the beach and ocean would not stay again there arefar farbetter places to stay for the same price would give this place a zero if i could well what can i say nothing too much trouble great staff room cleaned everyday pool overlooking sea free wifi in all rooms there is only 1 problem i found was no tea coffee making facility in room easy sorted big c kettle 250 baht lol no problem lol will stay everytime i go back I have stayed at the A A 5 or 6 times a year for the past few years and generally do not have a problem that was until last Friday. I reserved a room in the B building the previous Monday by telephone. On my arrival the receptionist told me there was no reservation and the only rooms available were suites in the B building (at a higher price) or rooms in the more inferior A Building. The person that took my reservation at first denied that I had called. The log on my phone confirmed the call. However, during the course of establishing where I was to stay she quoted parts of our conversation and then disappeared. When I challenged her again she agreed to the basic rate fot the suite and that I would have to move the next day. When I changed, the room had strong smells of cigarette and urine. This was dealt with by an air freshening spray. I asked to change the room but I was told the hotel was full. Despite my long patronage I felt my treatment was shoddy at the least. Suffice to say I moved to another hotel nearby and will not return to the A A. Good budget hotel. The standard room was spacious with plenty of storage, but no hangers in the closet. The cable TV is basic, but provides news and one movie channel. The hot water was intermittent during my stay. The room was cleaned and fresh towels provided daily. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The location puts you 5 minutes walk from the beach, and a short baht bus ride to walking Street or the large shopping mall. The hotel is located near bars, so you will hear the sound of live bands until the early hours, however they did not disturb my sleep. I paid $35 a night (cash), a credit card would incur an additional $1 per day. The value, location and staff made this a positive stay, and I would return. It is budget hotel nearly located pattaya beach. Hotel is not clean enough, dark . Sleeping quality is not good. Hotel personnel are lively in attitude. Worst thing of this hotel is their lift. You can only choose this for budget, short stay & location - few meter away from walking street. They always close their door to swimming pool. Best hote in pattaya for a comfortable and class stay. Rooms are big,clean and cozy.Big bathtub and big bathroom are great for couples.:P Location is great ..just few yards from the beach. Good room service and have a helpful staff. I loved my stay in AA. Already stayed here twice and looking forward for the third time. Best hotel in pattaya for taking women back to your room. No charge unlike most poxy hotels. Also the staff are excellent and so friendly. Sandy and Charlie are both amazing people who run and head the staff at the hotel and they do an outstanding job. It may be old and outdated as some other bloke was having a sad about in a review I read but it is still an Excellent Resort. The rooftop pool is awesome! Keep up the great work Charlie and Sandy and I will see you asap as I can get back there.    Blair O'Shannessy This is a great place. Staff are mint. Hotel location is good - 100yds from the beach in a quiet street. Straight opposite the hotel is a brilliant English Pub too. Breakfast is great in the hotel and in the pub. We are heading back soon. Good location on Soi 13 for all that Pattaya has to offer. Opposite a typical British pub but the road is relatively quiet for Pattaya.. The hotel is quite big with equally big rooms, dining area and a small swimming pool. The staff were helpful and the rooms clean. The underground parking is a bit of a squeeze but very handy and secure. i have stayed at this hotel twice. i think the managemnent has not any plan to keep their hotel update. the lift is old, the rooms like 20 years ago fashioned. the lobby is dark. and no internet in rooms. No WIFI. ! just can use the computer in lobby if you pay for them. No safe box in rooms.  they have 2 swimming pools. its not a bad hotel if the traveller is on a budget.  Just for a very good location the price is not bad also . its 3 minutes walk to beach and less than 1 minute walk to second road. We were booked into another recommended hotel near here and could not wait to leave, so booked into this hotel the next morning.    The rooms are large and airy. Completely adequate for what we needed. Proximity to everything is ideal!!    The staff are the friendliest I have met anywhere in the world!!! Lovely welcoming people.    Has two swimming pools.    If you want cheap and friendly accommodation right near the beach and all the nightlife, this is an excellent choice. It's not the Hilton but nor are the prices. Very happy with everything. Great hotel, great staff, great facilities. The owner is the most welcoming gent you could wish to meet. And the buffet breakfast is the best value in Asia, the hotel is a couple of minutes from all amenities. Would I return? Most defiantly. reception area is dark and dingy  Front desk staff are very good ans always try their best  Check in was not fast  Rooms are very small and shower made for short people .You have to bend down for the water to reach you  I found Cigarettes Burn holes in the bed sheets and the towels are old and has large Holes  I wake up with about 6 Bugs bite all over my Body  I saw Bugs crawling in the bathroom and I asked them to spray the room and they did but I have to be out of the room all day,    Position is very good 5 minutes to beach  restaurant looks old and dingy so I did not have meals. TV did not work we couldn't get the picture.  If you are in a very low budget may be you can stay there very near to walking street good friendly stuff good and cheep food free charge not very cline not new things in room good view of pattaya beach good pool all things considered this is an outstanding place to stay while on vacation in Pattaya... the rooms are complete with everything you will need to be comfortable...the staff simply could not be better or more accomodating... even allowing me to make long distance calls on their personal cell phones, arranging taxi from hotel to bkk airport..., n now that I have been here three times virtually treating me and my friend like family... it is an excellent value for the money, and I can see the same familiar faces still work there...I am looking forward to returning here, it will always be my 1st stop in town... I have been coming back to this hotel since 2003.Back in 2003 I just went to this hotel for Bhat80 breakfast buffet. I liked the decor,I liked the food,and the service. Then I felt tempted to see the room when the receptionist invited me to do so for my next round's stay/visit to Pattaya. I liked the wooden panelled bedroom so much that I decided to move in next couple of hours.The rate was Bhat700. Now a brand new wing has been added to this hotel with room rates ranging from Bhat1000 to Bhat 1400. The rooms in the old wing range from Bhat800 to Bhat1200. Originally they had a swimming pool in the roof (8th floor). Now they have another one on the first floor of the new wing. In ground floor restaurant buffet breakfast consisting of English and Thai food cost around Bhat90. Egg dishes are served freshly cooked.For bacon they charge Bhat30 extra. Service is excellent and seems to come from heart. Same applies to room service and poolside service. Rooms are spacious and so are the bathrooms/toilets. Bed sheets are changed daily and so are superior quality towels. There is adequately stocked minibar in each room. Safe deposit lockers are available. But 8am to 8pm are operating times.If you are checking out early it is important to clear the locker before 8pm on the previous evening.Overall standard of security is very good.Coming to location, the hotel is very conveniently placed in terms of local amenities- bars,nightclubs,shopping malls,massage parlours,internet cafes,beauty parlours, and you just name it. Two minutes walk will take you to sea front. The hotel reflects ,and maintains,an image of magnificience and respectability.As you enter the hotel or go to the dinning room you may be forgiven for thinking that it is a 4* establishment. As to value for your money you are unlikely to come across another hotel in Pattaya offering so much for so little in terms of comforts and safety. Hotel runs a very efficient and reliable airport transfer service,and again at a very reasonable rate.The travel agency operating from the hotel will look after all your travel and entertainment needs.Only draw back that I can think of is that none of the hotel rooms is sea facing. You can view the sea from either ends of hotel corridors on each floor.This apart you will love the hotel,all its amenities and above all its friendly staff.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.930608,100.880196&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.930608,100.880196&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.931667,100.879440|12.929736,100.877899|12.930410,100.879868|12.929733,100.877876|12.931495,100.879868|12.932666,100.884048|12.929448,100.881233|12.927647,100.877312&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.928656,100.879288|12.929643,100.880836|12.929769,100.883492|12.929709,100.878532|12.930843,100.881950|12.928686,100.879829|12.930698,100.881958&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.933609,100.881073|12.931111,100.884270|12.928896,100.879295|12.933420,100.881851|12.927748,100.883247|12.929098,100.880638|12.928466,100.882149|12.927894,100.883453|12.932431,100.882774&signature=n_5Ue9KCxx1fHdxJtapbWDSeVMk=",0.9999,Positive

We arrived at the condo after a huge trip (the distances were completely different from the ones at the reservation website - the whole description was a lie). When we arrived they had a huge sign saying ‚Äúwe are not a hotel‚Äù and knew nothing about our reservation. We called the number on the reservation confirmation and a person picks up and also knew nothing about our reservation. He then told us to go get the key at a mailbox. He was not there to receive us our to get the money. When we get to the room it was discusting, super dirty and full of hair and food leftovers. It had old food inside the fridge. It has a pair of shoes and a pair of underwear at the balcony. It felt like it was the home of somebody where we had to spend the night. IT WAS NOT OKAY, so I left and did not pay. The Cliff Condo has a great location between Pattaya and Jomtien. It's located in the Cosy Beach area. It's a 5 minute walk to the beach from the condo. The swimming pool is very large. Great for lap swimmers. You don't see many pools this big in the Pattaya area. However, you should be aware the Cliff does not want short-term renters. They require renters to sign a 30-day lease. Otherwise, renters are violating the Hotel Act of Thailand. The Cliff has posted a warning of 10,000 baht fines if renting under 30 days. Come enjoy the sun and fun at the Cliff! The Cliff Residence Condo    Pattaya    Great Vacation and Dental Treatment    510850758    Since years I stayed in Pattaya for 2 to 3 month during the summer and rented an apartment. One of the newest apartment buildings is The Cliff. This 27 story building is located 4 blocks of the Gulf of Thailand and beach. The building is well secured, has an elegant lobby, Olympic size pool, children's pool, whirl pool, state of the art exercise room. Apartments can be rented for a minimum of 3 days starting at 1000 Baht per day for a studio, one and two bed rooms are also available. The in-house renting and selling agent is Property Studio Com. LTD. Talk to Nui she is very accommodating and helpful, tell her Manfred send you. This company also provide cleaning and laundry service, taxi, rental car and motor bike service.  The high sea-side floors have a great view of the Gulf of Thailand and the many islands in the background every apartment has a balcony. I rented apartments in this building for the last 3 years and found the best equipped apartment is 2214 with a 55' flat screen smart TV with soundbar, DVD and CD player, floor to ceiling windows and doors, a large wash machine and all the pots and pants. The apartment has a king size bed and a sleeper for two.The building is located in the hills outside of Pattaya, with no public transportation, a taxi ride to town is about $4, I rented motor scooter 2500 Baht a month to be mobile.  If you need dental work the Pattaya International Dental Center is a modern and very professional dental practice. During the years my treatments included 5 implants, 2 crowns, 1 root canal and never had a problem. make an appointment with Dr. Narin tell him Manfred send you.  You can reach Pattaya from the Bangkok Airport by bus that will take you to Jomtien, from here you can take a taxi to reach your hotel. I made a reservation with limousine service in Thailand they will meet you at the airport, the price is 1500 Baht for the approximately 90 min ride in a new and comfortable Toyota Camry, a real bargain.  When I arrive in Thailand first I make a hotel reservation for 2 days, since most flights are overnight. I sleep one day and make my apartment rental arrangement the next day, hotels in walking distance are Cosy Beach hotel, or Royal Cliff Beach and Royal Cliff Grande. The exchange rate in the summer of 2017 was $1=33.5 baht. I definitely enjoy staying in apartments or condos in Pattaya.. feels like home... I have stayed here few times in 2016.... very close to cosy beach and few steps away from many restaurants... I definitely prefer this area over Pattaya beach road.. rooms are modern with lot of amenities... make sure to take a room on high floor with sea view... u can get an amazing sunset view In my opinion Cosy Beach is the best place to stay in Pattaya. Nice quiet area that is only a 10 minute taxi ride to the hustle and bustle of Walking Street.  Our one bedroom apartment at The Cliff Residence Condo had a small kitchen and lounge room, a nice modern bathroom and bedroom with king size bed.  The view was great from our balcony and we were about 10 minutes walk to the beach with some nice little restaurants along the way.  We had two issues that were a little annoying. Firstly, the pool slide wasn't working and looked like it hadn't worked for a while. Not a big issue but we did pick this hotel because of the pool as the grandson was coming over to stay once or twice.  Secondly, we arrived expecting to pay cash for our stay as this is a condo, not a hotel. But we arrived on a Sunday and there were no staff around. So, the security guard gave us our room key and had no further information for us. It took 3 days to work out how and where to pay. No staff we spoke to knew anything about accepting payment. If it had taken 6 days to work it out we would have been on our way home, money intact. Beautiful condo situated 5 mins from the hustle and bustle of Pattaya City. Incredible pool with great kids slide too, only 300mtrs from the beach which is lovely and clean. Lots of local shops, bars and restaurants located nearby too. As i live in the building for a while, had to leave review for guidance and some info.  They have 6 sizes of rooms, 38,48,72,74,91,102sq.m~  Very nice 46m. long pool, with fun slider, saunas gym.  Location is very nice and close to the beach but not for public transport, though there are many motorbike, and car taxies waiting downstairs, plenty of small shops and restaurants, some new very posh places wits perfect sea views.  If you are renting, using various sites to book, prices can vary dramatically.  Overall very nice place to live and to enjoy holiday or long term living.  Hope to see you here! The condo was great, it had a kitchenette + a balcony although it was a bit to hot for us to sit out, there was also a lot of construction around new places being built.  The pool looked inviting, although we were only there two nights so didn't get opportunity to try it out!  Could have been better equipped I.e. Only one mug and no duvet! Ok if you are on your own I guess!  It was excellent in value though This building is located right outside the hustle and bustle of Pattaya C.  It's 300 meter from one of the better beaches of Pattaya called Cosy Beach. But it's the pool area that really impressed me. - It's very beautiful and right next to the pool there is a well equipped gym.  The building is high end and everything is well maintained. The Wifi is the fastest I have tried in Thailand. The reception is open from 9 AM - 6 PM.  The area is quiet and a lot greener then the rest of Pattaya Central. But You are still very close to everything.  Walking Street, which is the nightlife center of Pattaya starts only 1,3 km away next to the Bali Hai Pier. This place is also where you drive fast go-cards and catch a cheap 30 min. ferry to the nearby island of Koh Lan. My warmest recommendations for this place. I really enjoyed it. Amazing location away from the hustle and bustle of inner Pattaya. Plenty of good food around, staff and security are polite and on point.    I stayed here for five days and must say that the view from the 23rd floor is breathtaking, daytime and night.

The room was very spacious and clean. I love the staffs here they are so friendly and attentive. We really like the Thai porridge side dish - Moo pud Nam Lieb - It was so nice. We had not stayed here before my holiday this year, taking a chance . We used to live nearbye on holiday but the owner sold his house. When we arrived We were welcomed and given an upgrade to a delightful room on the seventh floor, which would become our home tor the next month.. It is a busy hotel, but very efficient. The food, we enjoyed, although we only took breakfast . Thailand has so many wonderful places to eat in. The hotel itself is extremely clean, the staff very helpful, The top floor has a swimming pool where we swam everyday and 95 per cent of the time we had to ourselves. The location of the hotel is ideal, quiet,but near enough the town to visit, and to catch connections to Bangkok.. The hotels taxi service is excellent and you dont get ripped off. I will certainly return there again we stayed there 1 night, fortunately no longer    + tasty, basic breakfast  + nice swimming pool on the roof top    +/- rooms at first glance are ok, but in details you can see the poor quality of the hotel, but you get what you pay for, so do not expect much    - to the beach 7 minutes on foot through not a nice area, the beach is wide but paved, it has nothing to do with the paradise beach Tucked away in a quiet side street, this hotel offers decent bed and breakfast for a reasonable price. Rooms are basic, perfectly suitable for a night or two stays. Internet works just fine. There‚Äôs a swimming pool on a top floor with very nice view over north Pattaya. Car park is small and can accommodate only few cars. Stayed for a night and would definitely come back again next time. The rooms and other facilities are clean. Staff members are friendly even if they seemed not comfortable to speak English, they're still accommodating. The night duty at front desk let me use their phone charger for the whole night! Way different from our stay at Dvaree last week. Their staff should learn from The Ivory's staff on how to treat the customers right. We got the standard room at 1,200 including a decent, organized and clean buffet breakfast and we were treated the same as other high-paying customers. No discrimination here. Copy paste from my booking.com review    The good :    This was our second time staying at this hotel. The staff is helpful and polite and the rooms are spacious and comfortable. The breakfast buffet is great and we enjoyed the rooftop pool once again. Location a bit far but good if you need space from all the tourists that come Pattaya. This time we used the free parking and it's very convenient, location felt a lot better with a car.    The bad:    So if we love this hotel why did we rate it so low? At checkout we were tried to be charged for 2 bottles of mineral water from the minibar that we didn't consume. We quickly clarified that we didn't consume anything other than the free bottles of drinking water, and this is where the problem arised. The manager in charge at that time, instead of believing us, chose to call their employees and show us their ""inventory"" that said they gave us the item in dispute. Asked us once again if we were sure we didn't forget. This was insulting. In any case their inventory proved they made a mistake, and probably didn't re-stock the minibar from the previous customer that stayed there. To add more to her incompetence, she ""let"" the cleaning staff take responsibility for it and let her ""pay for it"". In reality there was no money involved as the product was never consumed, just an inventory error. The whole time this manager seemed to expect for us to pay, even if from the beginning we clarified we didn't consume anything. And she made a whole show out of it to try and blame us instead of taking responsibility for their mistake, WASTING our time. As soon as we said we don't use anything she should have completed checkout and let us go. Instead as the main representative of the hotel at the moment she chose to lose 2 customers, and many others than read and agree with this review forever.  To add more insult at the end she never appologized and I guess she didn't even realized the grave problem she caused for us, the hotel, and the staff she is supossed to lead. All of this because she didn't take responsibility for the hotel mistake and try to blame it on customers instead. THIS IS NOT HOW TO TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS. I was accommodated with my girlfriend from 31.12.2017 till 06.01.2018 at ivory villa. The hotel is nice, in a quiet area close to the main street and close to the beach. Breakfast is excellent, swimming pool with a great panorama. Everything was fine until the last day of the stay when the receptionist at check out (i don't remember the name) tried to make us pay 2 towels on the ground as we spotted:)) really?!? For this are done towel . All the staff have a poor English. We did spend one night only. Hotel is situated in a quiet soi away form hustle and bustle of pattaya. Rooms are just fine for a couple. Breakfast buffet simple yet acceptable. Very nice swimming pool on a rooftop with pretty views over the city. Staff very helpful.  Cons - walls are very thin, tv can be heard from other room as well as other noise. Internet is very slow.  All in all, decent low budget option around north of Pattaya for one or two night max. I was in the hotel on begin of Sep. Room was very nice and clean. Hotel room decorated in white color feel very clean and cozy bed very big I got triple room one king size bed and one single bed was very big and comfort. There was car park in the hotel that was enough for clients. Hotel's staff was very nice and gave me good advice services very good. Hotel ABF are full in 3 stars hotels that was very nice and satisfy clients needed. overall of the hotels very good I would recommended We just came back from our holiday. We stayed here 10 days at the end of February. The staff were very friendly and helpfull. The room was clean with enough space for your bags,air-con and fridge in the room-what was very good. We had a good size balcony as well. On the top u can find a pool and u have qa great view for the ocean. We definetly want to come back. The room was nice, clean and standards. The hotel has small lobby but efficient. Like the design. The location is quite difficult to find for the first timer. Rooftop pool at the top has great view. Standard breakfast was serve. This hotel is highly recommended. Cost at the right price, would love to be back again. Away from noise and Pattaya hustle, yet close to food strip.  Opposite side of town so not good if looking for close to Jomtiem beach.  Clean and tidy with professional and respectful staff.  Rooftop pool has 360 degree views.  Would stay again for sure. Situated in quiet area. All the basic amenities. Clean room. Average restaurant and breakfast. Isolated far from main attraction only Good for visitors with Car. Can walk to near by beach and convenient store. This is my second time back in the hotel the service is really nice. Breakfast is delicious and the room is comfy! Love the peaceful environment. The pool is a kill here! They have a rooftop pool which really beautiful. will come back again:) More expensive than some hotels around but very nicely presented. Clean rooms with plenty of space and a balcony. Fully functioning air conditioning which we found essential. Wifi is very temperamental particularly in the rooms but worked well downstairs. Very nice pool, very quiet with a good view. Breakfast was ok, cold eggs not recommended though! Staff were nice and friendly but we had a few problems when trying to order a taxi so this may be best done elsewhere. About 150m west of the North Pattaya road, down the narrow but safe soi 25, is the fairly new Ivory Villa. We had a room on 6 th floor with one king and one single bed. Room is good, mattress not great, springs very obvious on getting in and out. Wifi only works at the door, and dies 1m inside the room. Good toilet and shower, OK balcony with view of the better but expensive hotels on wongamat. Breakfast was ok for free, reasonable parking. Rooftop pool is good but no shallow end for kids or easy access for less able. One lift is slow. Service is good and staff OK but not engaging. stayed at this hotel 25th december till 6 Jan room 606 room is big beds are great pool area nice no bar and views are great will defo book again thank you ivory villa hotel for making my holiday a good 1 and thank you thailand When we found this hotel 2 years ago we thought it was wonderful. BUT after three stays there we probably won't go back. They have a real problem with water and after many complaints they show no attempt to fix it. We have never had a hot shower here. The shower water is always freezing and there is only a trickle in the sink.  The breakfast is very poor really your basic Thai farang fare, They can't even put a heater under the eggs so they are always cold.  Having said that the rooms are good. The bed is very comfortable. A double and single in every room. There is a beautiful rooftop pool and garden and parking on site.  Don't pay the extra for a higher floor/ more expensive room. The rooms are all the same the only difference is a slightly better view from the higher floors.  If they ever sort out their hot water problem we might go back as the location is good for us. Better if u have a car.. The room are ok , the hotel is new so the rooms are still in good condition.  The view from the room is beautifull we stayed on the 7-th floor and was probably the best view in the hotel , room 709  The roof top of the hotel is nice ...for some photos.  The swimming pool is small , the places by the swimming pool are not enough for all the customers....so we did not get a free space ...so we did not hang by the pool.  The maid was ok, cleening was made in the right way.  The wi-fi , is bad....really bad, even after we informed the staff that we have a problem , still was no improvements , earlly morning no internet , and later very bad....  The hotel is not on the beach , so you need to walk around 15 min to get to the beach , and the nearest beach it not the best one :), but you can find many places by the beach in Pattaya.  If your travelling in group, you just ask the guys on the reception to bring you a car from the main road to take you whatever you need to go , it will cost you 150 to 300 baht.  Overall the hotel is ok, good value for the money....if you're not an internet addict :) I stayed at the hotel for a night with my girl gang (3 of us). We booked Junior suite for just $85 with breakfast included, however the room layout does not support extra bed (but standard room does). With sexy bathroom and walking distance from the entrance road to the hotel, i think the hotel suit couple with car only. If you are not neither a couple or driving then skip this hotel. Such helpful friendly people here - They let me do some printing several times whilst I stayed, behind the reception. Amazing position, just a few minutes walk off Naklua Road. Pick a room with a sea view that looks towards the architecturally ugly monster, known as the 'Centara Grand' Hotel - You can look at it knowing the people staying there are pay some stupid extortionately expensive price, of which just being on the beach is factored into it (All sewage in Pattaya runs straight into the sea untreated, therefore, step into the sea with caution!) The view from the roof is phenomenal, you can see right across to Jomtien tower/ Sunsets are awesome. The pool on the roof is also a very decent size, width and depth. Rooms are really comfy, with a massive 'watering can' style shower. I've stayed in several places in Pattaya, and this is Seriously great value (the best of all). I stayed in Ivory Seaview with bathtub. The room is huge and all white. I personally think that this hotel is good for long stay. a bit disappointed that this room is the best category but there is no safety box. From the website pictures look modern but in the shower room has black mold. the bathtub look nice, the glass window is see through to the far away beach. Once we arrived at 13.45, the elevator was fixing until 14.15 the maintenance wise should be at night, not suring check in time. By the way, bed is a bit hard, various TV Channel.  Overall, it's ok for budget hotel. Stayed in april for 9 nights. Plenty of places to eat and drink nearby and a brisk walk and your at the beach in about 5 minutes.    Rooms were large and clean good ac in room and balcony. Had tea making facilities in room with complimentary coffee. mini bar was also available and had cable tv that had thai russian and some english channels with a good movie channel.    Pool on rooftop was nice too.    Negatives. Wifi in my room didnt work and considering the wifi box was right outside my room I could never connect unless I was outside my room and held my phone upto the wifi box.    Mentioned it to reception on a couple of occasions but after the third or fourth time they asked if I wanted to change rooms but by this time I was over it.    Breakfast. Had plenty of choice and was tasty but could of been mote tasty had the food been kepted warm.    When we first checked in I could get a freshly cooked omelette in the morning but when the hotel got full they just kept giving me an excuse that the chef was on holiday so couldnt have an omelette which was a bit disappointing.    Overall I would stay here again. Large rooms (super strange layout), very clean, nice pool on the rooftop. Staff is unfriendly, breakfast a catastrophe (selection, situated in a cellar), too expensive overall - there are much better places for this price in Pattaya. Caution: place is located in a dark side street. The hotel is in a reasonable location in North Pattaya, just walk to head of road and it's a main Baht Bus route into town. Alternatively it's only about 20 mins walking to hit the nightlife in the centre. Room was extremely good and clean as it's quite a new hotel. Rooftop pool was great. Breakfast was a disappointment, some items had obviously been put out for several days and were crusting over. Nothing was hot and a request for a couple of hot fried eggs resulted in some 'discussion' about what was wrong with the 16 ice cold fried eggs already out! I don't expect that from staff. I'd probably stay again but not include breakfast, there's enough places within a couple of minutes walk for that. The staff seemed disinterested in general, not rude but gave impression they'd rather continue chatting amongst themselves and guests were a hindrance to that. It was comfortable and clean, and if the service was pepped up it would be an excellent hotel. This hotel is brand new and locate in ""Na Klua"" or ""North Pattaya"" area. It's not close to main road,need to walk for 5 mins from hotel. I'm not recomend you to walk from hotel to main road alone in night time.Mostly I always see foreign tourist walk in group.    Room is big and clean, 2 bed inside (staff told me that they offer extra bed for Chinese tour group) Free wifi,Free parking,Flat Tv. and free drinking water.    This hotel is not close to the beach,need to walk for 800-900 metr from hotel.    However,staff are good service mind. Not many choice for breakfast but taste good.    Don't forget to visit swimming pool on roof,last time I go there it's still underconstruction...so sad. Firstly location: From the Dusit Thani Circle go up the Naklua Road about 1/3 mile then turn left opposite Ayiala Hotel. Down that road about 250 yards on the left.  We had a De Luxe room which was spacious and contained a fridge, flat screen tv, large walk in shower, Double bed, single bed and balcony. Aircon of course.  The fridge stayed on all the time and so we were able to have ice on hand for late night drinks although it has to be said the ice box was very small, but enough for 3 - 4 ice trays.  The room was bright and modern and well serviced by a very friendly chambermaid, who always had a smile for the guests.  Breakfast was included in the price and had a large selection of food including fruit, cereals and thai food but there was a limited selection for Western tastes, but the chef was happy to prepare me an omlette when i asked. Like most Thai hotels I have stayed at, the cooked food was mostly left to get cold even though at this hotel there were burners under the food storage hoppers but they were not often lit. Cold fried eggs are not to my taste! But overall the breakfast was reasonable value.  My only other concern with this hotel was the WiFi which could not be trusted and kept going on and off at different times during the day. My partner, a local Pattaya lady told me that the WiFi Company concerned did have a reputation for not delivering a 100% reliable service. Mostly this was ok for checking e mail and occasional surfing but for the business traveller who needs 100% reliable WiFi this could be a problem. I did intend at one stage to buy airline tickets online but obviously with the relatively large amount of money involved, i decided against it, due to the risk of the WiFi connection failing at a sensitive part of the transactions.  There is a safe in each room, a good size, big enough for a lap top. I did manage to break my safe combination lock for a short time but the reception were happy to lend me the safe key until my safe was fixed but although i handed back the key to reception, when i got back to England I heard from the Hotel that they could not find the key and wanted me to send it back ! So be warned, get a receipt if the same thing happens to you!  There is a 15 metre swimming pool on the 8th and top floor of the hotel which i would highly recommend, the water was very warm and always spotlessly clean and had a good selection of loungers.  Overall I would certainly recommend this hotel, good value, staff all charming, friendly and happy to help with any problems. The only reason for me not giving the hotel 5 stars is the internet problem.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=15&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.957663,100.888779&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.957663,100.888779&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.958720,100.886070|12.959459,100.886894|12.957578,100.888878|12.956059,100.889862|12.958417,100.885742&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.955278,100.890602|12.958667,100.884949|12.958895,100.885231|12.957106,100.891983|12.956288,100.889046|12.958258,100.889267|12.955101,100.890587|12.958486,100.888756|12.958459,100.892700&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.958800,100.885796|12.958015,100.888489|12.959042,100.887306|12.953860,100.887932|12.959659,100.887077|12.956101,100.887009|12.953458,100.889191|12.960558,100.887566|12.959488,100.889458&signature=TyKBu9Ro4j_3JEbBQpu2U6pqa7M=",1.0,Positive
38,"VILLA WANIDA GARDEN RESORT $23 ($Ã∂3Ã∂1Ã∂) - Prices & Hotel Reviews - Pattaya, Thailand - Tripadvisor","If you think all 5-star swanky hotels looks increasingly similar, you are in for a treat at Villa Wanida. The design of the hotel aims to create a peaceful, cosy mini-jungle with ethnic furniture such as potteries and pavilions. If you are a horticulture-minded visitor, you will love the care and variety of flora and fauna there. The attention to the plants and trees is meticulous and tastefully done., hence the lushness of the place. The setting and surrounding is serene and hard to find in expensive hotels.  The two swimming pools are designed with a touch of cuteness. Plus the swings and the animal pottery decorations, I can see this is a good family accommodation. A safe and interesting place for kids to roam around.  The rooms are a little aged but the front porch is a lovely place to relax.  The breakfast is very good and generous and is a fusion of West-Thai cuisine.  Service standard is high.  Maybe we travelled at a low season, or more precisely, the COVID season. The occupancy rate is understandably low. The place looks immaculate and clean. This is very nice if you want to get away from the clubs in the beach area.    Some whay little noisy when there are groups of people who just come back from the clubs but relatively ok comparing with others. Peaceful for sure being isolated.  Clean but why bad breakfast mini buffet also in room charging thb 100 per extra towel....reasonable good values for short times stay..  Economical on soaps but comfortable for spartatians visitors asking for little entertaiment or none..... A little off location but it is offset by a little more secluded feeling.Nothing spectacular but a reliable accommodation.Well appointed rooms, well maintained pool, in short, an affordable accommodation options Really big spacious rooms 2 great clean pools and amazingly well kept garden with beautiful plants and trees. Everything here is clean and well kept. The staff is friendly and you will get away from the city. If youre coming to Pattaya for party or gogo bars this is not the place. This is a place for relaxation. The first thing that pleasantly surprised me and my friends was the beauty of the place. The place is full of trees and plants. The rooms are really big and very well maintained with every bit of furniture that one can need. The staff is also very courteous and helpful. The one thing that was not too good was the wifi connectivity. It took ages to connect. Also, network speeds in the area are bad.    The only thing inconvenient about the place was its location. It is quite far from the beach road. The hotel does provide transfers to its guests, but it can be a little expensive. Since Pattaya does not have a proper metered taxi service in the city, we usually had no choice but to go for the one provided by the hotel. Wow if u do not want the crazy loudness, friendly folks who will go the extra mile even when there is a language barrier. they were truly wonderful and we will come back again! really enjoyed the pool, fruit shakes, and onion rings! Villa Wanida Garden Resort is a wonderful hotel with an elegant atmosphere.  The owner, the staff and many others work hard to keep this place perfect!!!  The rooms are exceptional including awesome tub w/shower, small wet bar, 2 desks, great cable TV & WiFi, nice atmospheric lighting system, room service, just really nice place!!! Stayed in this resort on April 14, 2015. Situated a bit off the main city but very peaceful resort. 2 swimming pools. The treed planted in the resort gives a wonderful look and peace. Swings for kids keep them engaged. Good breakfast. On request arranged vegetarian dishes also. Options could have been more. My boyfriend and I stayed there for 2nights over New Year- the gardens are beautiful & the whole resort feels very relaxed!  Rooms were big, clean & spacious & the shower was amazing too!  The staff on reception were helpful & arranged taxis for us giving us good advice about prices etc  Food was good & very reasonably priced- no vodka available from the bar though which was a shame. Breakfast basic but enough to start your day!  It's a bit far out from the main party bars - around 20mins in a taxi costing 200-300baht.  Would def recommend to couples, families and those looking for a relaxing stay! I will start off by saying that this resort is truly beautiful. The vegetation is stunning giving the resort an extremely peaceful ambience. The staff are gracious and will do anything they can to help you. To this end l have never been to another resort where there are so many people employed to keep the resort looking so immaculate. There is really only one thing that I have concerns about (and this was highlighted by another reviewer) the breakfast food that should be served hot, is cold! Like the other reviewer also stated,the room service food is great and hot,so why are guests expected to eat the cold breakfast food? Several excuses were put forward about the cold breakfast food, not enough people, we open at 6,30am it is hot at that time of day. Hmmmm well sorry I am on holidays and I am not getting up at that time unless I need to catch a plane! This resort is great in almost every respect, but someone really needs to take the bull by the horns and deal with this issue of cold food. Resolve that Villa and in my opinion you have a first class resort. We went for a short, relaxing break away from Bangkok. What we got, was far from that. We encountered surly, rude and poorly trained staff from the moment we arrived. We went to the pool, and shortly after our arrival we were joined by a number of obnoxious Thais and their loud sound system. Ok, each to their own, so we went to our room. Except, shortly after, the hotel's own sound system cranks up, and our walls and windows are vibrating with the overkill bass that is so loved out here.    The hotel's name - Villa Wanida Garden Resort - gives an impression of peace and tranquility; don't be fooled, and don't stay there. I have stayed at Villa Wanida twice this year, the first time I could not fault the place, the gardens are beautiful the pools are both excellent, the staff around the place do what ever they can to help you, but my second visit was not as good.  On my second day I complained that the breakfast was cold, the receptionist apologised and assured me it would not happen again, well on the 5 day I went for breakfast at 730am thinking the food would be hot, how wrong I was, now the staff asked if I wanted it reheated (No thanks its been uncovered for over an hour now), what is annoying is that when you pay for room service food here, it is excellent, so why don't they care about the breakfast ....  Also with this in mind, there is no microwave or cooker in the rooms just a kettle, so you cant simply heat a snack.  My other issue is the noise that some guests make from 7am onwards, this is not challenged by anyone here, I have noticed the resort here is expanding, its sad to see that when this happens the service tends to nose dive. Also charging 50 baht for an extra pillow is ridiculous but original ! ive never heard of that before.Must do better Villa Wanida, Im off to ride 5 km to get some breakfast. I can't say any dissatisfaction with this resort hotel. The food was awesome for being authentic thai and you can just tell the kitchen if u want it on the milder side... Well i did go all the way ""hotly"" authentic. They had bubble pools and the ambience was very homey... The garfen feeling of the place was refreshing and to top it all, they have great service. Very friendly staff. I appreciate their warm welcome when I was here. I'd definitely recommend! Visited Villa Wanida in October 2012 where we were conducting some training. The staff were exemplary, catering for the fussy food habits of our children, and the hospitalisation of one of our group - with warmth and humour.    The facilities were fantastic, with two swimming pools, outdoor chess, bikes for the children. There was enough to see locally with shopping, restaurants, Elephant park and Tiger Zoo. Sad to see how Thailand has sold much of its beauty to creepy international travellers; but what a beautiful people and country. Hi we stayed at this resort for 03 nights and wish we could stay for longer as it was so beautiful and calm.The break fast was very filling and varied.The pool was very clean and the kitchenette in room was an added bonus.The staff was very helpful and even arranged a foot massage for us at the pool area at 9 at night.  This place is ideal for families who want to stay a little away from the touristy Pattaya.  Tuk Tuk took 200 Baht to take us to the beach area and return by taxi cost us 300 Baht. We stayed here while on a holiday to thailand. Its an amazing destination in itself if you are looking to relax away from the crowded cityscape. It has an amazing pool area, beautiful landscaped gardens.  The villa provided was fairly large with all amenities u will need. A well equipped kitchenette and a dining area will make u feel right at home.  Its a must visit for those who want to get away from city and seek peace and tranquility. On and they provide bicycles to move around in campus, which was a nice addition.  But its not for those who wish to be connected to major areas as this one is a bit far away from main areas of pattaya. Excellent service the staff made us more than welcome and could not do enough for us.You cannot fault a stay at the villa wanida garden resort, a stress free holiday with excellent surroundings.The location is ideal for a peaceful break,. The food is superb , the rooms are spotless, and the pool area is lovely .  Very happy with the service and experience overall Had a blast!! The resort is set in a lovely tropical garden environment. We booked the triple room with one kingsize and one smaller bed, ideal for a kid. The room was really spacious with balcony, kitchen area, a small dining table, plenty of closets and a large bath tub. The area is very quiet at night and we had a good sleep all through the late morning, thanks to the dark curtains and quiet air-condition. Only drawback were the soft mattresses, which we're not used to. But others may like it. The main swimming pool is also very nice and our son really loved it.  The food offered in the restaurant is generally OK, but the breakfast was a bit of a disappointment.  One word of caution: this place is very far from Pattaya city center and the next attractive beach, so if you don't have your own transport you're at the mercy of the local taxi operators... this is the best hotel on its kind for the economic travellers. full of tropical trees and garden. two clean outdoor pools and good services, helpful staff, calm and relaxing area.  only far from city center and hard to get there without car or motor bike. pools are not allowed to use after 8 pm and breakfast is not very special. We chose this resort based on the generally positive reviews we read about it and we weren't disappointed. The garden was very lovely, the deluxe room we had was spacious, clean and neat. The overall ambiance of the resort is tranquil and relaxing, a stark contrast to the crowded Pattaya. Definitely recommended for those who wants to be in Pattaya yet away from Pattaya ;) Villa Wanida Garden Resort is a peaceful and wonderful resort with reasonable prices, large rooms and a stunning garden and a nice envirinment compared to the busy and crowded Pattaya. You will find it charming and nice! We booked this online after reading a couple of reviews. When we were heading there no one knew where it was or had heard of it. We eventually found a sign pointing down a dirt track, we drove about 800 yards and it was looking worse and worse until we pulled into the drive of this Caribbean-esque self-contained resort!! The place was so beautiful, several staff were on duty to greet us and were tidying up single fallen leaves, the place was paradise! There are 2 pools to choose from, both as lovely as each other. The staff were amazing, the food in the restaurant was lovely, the breakfast was basic but quite a variety. The 2 rooms were had were situated in like a beach house looking building which had 2 separate front doors but an adjoining door inside which was handy for us lads using each others toiletries and having a few drinks together. I am 100% going back again. It cost me approx ¬£13 per night per person. INCREDIBLE!!! What can I say about Villa Wanida other than the place is simply stunning?!?!    We stayed here on 11th December 2012 for 4 nights after arriving in Thailand the day before, and what a very pleasant shock we had when we arrived here!!!!    Firstly, on your way to the resort don't be put off by the long ""dirt track"" road which takes you down to Villa Wanida..... We all had horrible visions of what the place would be like but rest assured you're on your way to an oasis of beauty, luxury and tranquility!    Other people have already pointed out how lovely and peaceful it is but I should mention that yes it is a way from the main strip but the hotel organised taxi only cost us B400 (approx ¬£8) to the town centre and that's for 6 people!! Trust me it's a great location, unless you want to [try to] sleep with loud music thumping through your room at 5am above a nightclub?!?! Thought not! :-)    The hotel staff are brilliant, speak good English and the food was also very very nice and very fresh. The breakfast was fine for us and included hot meats, eggs, toast, jams, cereal, fruit and juices!    I will certainly be coming back to stay here again, that's 100% a promise as I absolutely love this hotel and can't rate it high enough!    All in all, I think you'd be mad not to stay here!! Stayed here only 1 night, my last night in Thailand, stayed as a treat, next time i will stay longer, very peacefull setting, could be way out in the coutryside but really only 700m from main highway.    Yes it is a little way out from Pattaya, but if you want to relax away from the fun for a few days i couldn't recomend it higher.    Staff were lovely, food was good, pool by the reception was too peacefull, could have slept in it.    Even the lizards were cool and friendly....... This resort is truly family owned and run. It is a little away from the center of Pattaya, and for a traveler with family, thank god for that    Designed and built by an ex banker, the resort is managed and run by him, his wife and daughter Feya.    For any resort at any price range this has got to be one of the best gardens and landscapes I have ever seen. And I have seen most of them all from Bill Bensley, Made Vijaya to Site Concepts etc. What makes it even more creditable is that he has no formal training in landscape design or architecture or interiors for that matter    Built in phases from money earned by building and selling villas nearby, this place is really peaceful and a super getaway for both Thais and foreigners looking for a quiet family oriented resort at Pattaya    The beaches in Pattaya are anyway not that great for swimming and water sport. You have to go to either Koh Larn or at least 30 min further south of Pattaya to find decent beaches    Please do not go to this resort with expectations of a high end resort and professional service. This is truly a family run place (with the owners wife not afraid to pick up and mop the place when needed as well as jump into her luxury sedan and head to the market to pick up some supplies    Feya the owners daughter is formally educated in Australia and we ended up turning to her most of the time for advise and help. She runs the FO and restaurant which by the way serves the best Thai food I have had so far in Thailand    The staff are NOT fluent in English but are fairly easy to communicate with, ever smiling and always happy to help. My daughter had the best part of her holiday here and she was really indulged in and cared for by Feya and her staff    2 lovely swimming pools, beautiful manicured gardens and lawns. We cannot not praise this place enough. They arranged for a nice taxi to take us around. But most of the time we were contented to just stay put, play giant chess, petanque or just chill out by the pool    The villa style rooms are massive with big comfortable beds, a little kitchenette, a nice bathroom and a verandah and also a small sit out at the back    They have plenty of cycles that you can use and you can even apparently rent a scooter to go around. Please be aware that you do require an international license and it is illegal to scoot around without a helmet on (despite what you see in Pattaya)    Once again a big thank you to Feya, your Mum and Dad and the rest of the Villa Wanida team... We will be back We stayed for nine nights with three very small children and I have only good things to say. The gardens around the bungalows are beautiful and impeccably maintained, there are toys provided to play with in swimming pool, bicycles on loan (no charge), free wi-fi, and our kids were even offered horseback riding at 5pm daily (again at no charge). Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The only drawbacks may be (1) breakfast may not satisfy all, as it has the choice of American or three versions of rice/noodle dishes,  (2) the place is nowhere near the beach, as it is 500 m from main (Sukhumvit) road, and transport can take a long time in Pattaya. Thus not suitable for those who want to spend most days on the beach. Stayed here in July 2011 with my family.This resort is away from all the hustle and bustle of Pattaya , in beautiful garden surroundings.This is a family run business and the staff were very friendly and helpful.    The resort is fairly new. The rooms are beautiful and clean with a large bathroom.The beds some of the most comfortable I have slept in anywhere, a rarity for Thailand.    There is a lovely swimming pool suitable for children and adults alike.My children also used complementary bicycles to ride around the resort.    We only used the restaurant for breakfast, and this was my biggest complaint. There was a very limited selection of food. If you wanted Western food there was only eggs bacon and toast. No cereal and the fruit selection was pineapple and watermelon every day, and not always the best quality. The Orange juice was not fresh juice but appeared to be orange squash.    However the resort was so nice that the poor breakfast would not stop me returning. A word of caution though, we had our own transport so getting around was no problem but if you did not have transport the resort is well away from the main road and there is nothing else in the area. We actually liked this but it could be a problem if you wanted to get out and about and did not have transport. Villa Wanida is just perfect for those seeking a quiet getaway but within 10 minutes drive from the very centre of Pattaya. It's a family run business and only 18 months old and the general upkeep is very high. Service is very good with friendly staff and the rooms are the most spacious I have ever come across in Thailand for the money. The smart decor and attention to detail in the rooms is significant. Facilities on site include a family size swimming pool, a small fitness room, a full size boules court, outdoor giant chess, darts and free use of bicycles for resort guests.  Stays over a week might drag unless one is totally into isolation as the resort is down a very quiet street without any buses or shops nearby, which in itself could be appealing to some or for those with their own transport.  Breakfast is average but considering it's included in a very competitive room rate, it's a steal with a buffet running when their are enough guests, otherwise it's ABF and rice soup with fruit 'style' a la carte.  If the resort owner would employ a complimentary shuttle vehicle service to downtown and back a few times a day I'm sure the place would double it's visitor traffic.  Bring your own LAN cable as the resort's (provided) is just one metre short. Internet is complimentary but it's a hastle changing from LAN in the rooms to wifi by by the pool with the passwords the reception hands out, but the connection is fast enough and completely free! How bad is that!  The food in the restaurant is pretty good, a reasonable price and there are no plus plus taxes which is an added bonus. An ice cream cone is only 20b!","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=11&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971217,100.919937&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971217,100.919937&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.932566,100.880280|12.936627,100.886177|12.971953,100.887581|12.950249,100.888557|12.931667,100.879440|12.948019,100.889732|12.928205,100.876030|12.935137,100.882889|12.943296,100.888634&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.927536,100.876404|12.935059,100.882851|12.930101,100.879837|12.930322,100.878181|12.945942,100.888512|12.923672,100.882370|12.950147,100.890152|12.951410,100.887962|12.928656,100.879288&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.945284,100.886589|12.944347,100.887108|12.933609,100.881073|12.945731,100.888847|12.970123,100.884201|12.931111,100.884270|12.945134,100.891823|12.928896,100.879295&signature=OBtLAfOZnnJtBwMvgANcDO_xb94=",1.0,Positive
39,"W1A JOMTIEN - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","Booked a room for 7 nights. As I was on my way from my previous hotel to this hotel I received a missed call an hour prior to check-in time. No voicemail or emails. After arriving at the new hotel the whole hotel was locked down and no staff present. The hotel has been closed for several days but they didn't bother to make sure they weren't no longer listed online. Giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because of the pandemic. This was booked by my son in United Kingdom for me and my wife, it was near to where they was staying, Found it to be very good and worth the value paid, wifi OK small breakfast also available , staff very good. I liked this guesthouse. They do everything right down to the decor, staff friendliness and even the small rooms are well designed and laid out to maximize comfort. Unfortunately for me, it was in an area that was less than desirable and I found parking tough. I ended up not staying the night as I had an important meeting the next day and I could only imagine the raucous night ahead. Maybe just my imagination and under another circumstance, I would give it a chance. Staff went out of their way to make sure nothing was wrong on their end. I assured them it was just a personal choice and not their fault. If you are looking to stay in that area W1A looks like it would be your best choice. Stayed here for 3 days its a great place and the care taker is a charming lady  Loved the breakfast and a providing me breakfast at late woo hours as well.    The bathrooms were clean and well maintained, the room and decor was greatly done and the bed was cosy what one needs after all... As mentioned by previous guests the place looks fantastic, has good and quiet AC and has amazing staff but it has two disadvantages;  1) The drains smell....  2) The doors to the bathroom in all rooms squeak like anything. I suppose it is a fault in the doors because I never heard such loud squeaking anywhere and I have been to hundreds of hotels in my life.  In any case at the price and considering the area is quieter than most in Pattaya this is still a good deal. Just ask to be as far as possible from rooms with Chinese guests because they live up to their reputation of being very noisy. Stayed here for 3 nights. Staff were lovely. Room was basic but had all you needed. Bed was comfortable. Shower was hot. WiFi was good. Free coffee, tea, biscuits and noodles all day. And free breakfast, toast and cereal and orange juice. Only complaint would be the room had a smell of drains which could be quite strong at times. Stayed here for 1 night with a couple of friends. The room and bathroom is great and clean. Staff speaks great English. They also provide free simple breakfast (cereals, toasts, coffee, tea, and instant noodles)    The location is also great as it is on google maps and it's pretty easy to find. And it's located near Jomtien Beach too I booked a room for four persons (2x queen bed.)  Room really clean and it has big space.  Staff really friendly and helpful - speak English well.  Free cup of noodles.    Breakfast - bread, jam, butter, coffee, chocolate, milk, orange juice.    Motorbike parking space right infront of the hotel. Its great deal with palm ...she is so helpful and caeing lady .hotel is like home no waiters no extra charges for food and coffee. kids love this place for near by the beach .lots of street food near by hotel. Good design ,bed comfortable and great warm welcome. Located is not far from beach able to walk 2-5 minutes. There was small kitchenette that provide free noodle,bread + jam, milk, juice in morning at 1 fist floor. W1A    A real hidden gem in a brilliant location. Didn't have many reviews so we took a gamble, but all paid off.    The staff were beyond helpful, but also made us feel incredibly comfortable and at home.    The hotel decor is minimalistic with concrete floors and funky bright furniture, it looks bright quirky and vibrant.    There is a shared kitchen in the lobby, you can help yourself to biscuits, hot drinks and noodles all complementary.    The rooms are basic but still go with the theme of the rest of the building and are absolutely IMMACULATE.    We came back to a fresh bed and towels every day, clean bathroom and even sometimes our clothes folded neatly on the bed (that we'd lazy thrown next to our bed in a hurry to get ready.. sorry). The cleaner was also extremely pleasant and smiley.    The hotel is about a 10 minute uber from central Pattaya but also has the beach 5 minute walk in a straight line down the road.    Do not be alarmed when you see the road it is on, there are a few noisy bars but also local shops, salon and laundrette and all of them are so pleasant as you walk by and ask how you are.    We enjoyed our stay so much we extended by 3 nights. Since leaving we've compared other hotels to our room and wished we was back there.    Well done to the staff, you do an amazing job and you should be really proud of what you have achieved. An honest, reliable and welcoming place to stay. I stayed here for one night. I liked the rooms. Funky design. Bed was very comfortable. Room was Quiet, good AC. Wifi was good. Everything was very clean. Staff super friendly. Great value! Location 5 or so minutes to the beach. Had free 2 min noodles which was good for a quick snack. There was bikes which I didn't use but could be handy. Booked a room for 7 nights.

There was bikes which I didn't use but could be handy.","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=811x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.887975,100.881264&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.887975,100.881264&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.891585,100.874062|12.893725,100.873589|12.894530,100.874718|12.894286,100.874382|12.893980,100.873970|12.889828,100.885712|12.884890,100.879608&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.890053,100.874954|12.885761,100.881668|12.890499,100.879494|12.893726,100.876503|12.886470,100.877922|12.880282,100.884209|12.892040,100.873306|12.885211,100.881126|12.894398,100.874542&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.883675,100.883583|12.892222,100.876945|12.880233,100.884117|12.880930,100.887001|12.891152,100.875732|12.885908,100.878601|12.891460,100.876312|12.884017,100.881950|12.884031,100.883522&signature=ac5JLxpOUcBRQ3ig6zqgrgPIBN0=",1.0,Positive
40,"WHITE SAND BEACH RESIDENCES - Prices & Hotel Reviews (Jomtien Beach, Pattaya)","One of the best residence to stay when visiting Pattaya.  I stay at one bedroom suite, room is spacious(1 br + 1 LV room). Bathroom has perfect sea view, separate bathtub and shower. Pantry in living room has big refrigerator, microwave, electric stove, hot pot and kitchenware.  The best thing in this room is the panoramic sea view!! You can enjoy the amazing view all day long by your private balcony. Residence has a big pool and few step to the beach.  Staffs are friendly only not feel like hotel atmosphere but it is ok.  PS. Only this period, residence does not provide food and beverages so you have to arrange by your own. Our room was large enough and quite all right. We had a sea view and was satisfied with the hotel, our room, the breakfast and the possibility of strolling along the beach.  Look for more reviews by MulleEllum. This is not hotel but kind of Condo .....  Pool is closed, no Towel on the beach, no pool bar, no water for outside shower !!! Breakfast is friendly but quality is poor.  Room, have to say studio, is big and bed confortable and nice view but no mini bar!  Above all no ambience, no mood....  This is definitely not a 5 stars place üò¢üò¢üò¢ My husband and I had such a wonderful time. We stayed for 3 nights in a 2 bedroom cornered apartment. It felt so cozy just like home. It's a beautifully designed room with a spacious space. What we loved most was the view which was overlooking the Marina. Staff were extremely delightful and courteous. Room Service food was delicious with reasonable price. The pool was nice a quite. We enjoyed the walk on the beach to the Marina. It's the best location in Pattaya for us. Definitely, we will visit again. ‡∏õ‡∏Å‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏à‡∏∞‡∏û‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà Movenpick ‡πÅ‡∏ï‡πà‡πÄ‡∏´‡πá‡∏ô‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡πÉ‡∏ô Zone Residence ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏û‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏Å‡πá OK ‡∏Å‡πá‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÑ‡∏õ‡∏û‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏ú‡πà‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà White Sand Beach ‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πà‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏à‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏≥‡∏ò‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏à‡∏ô‡∏î‡∏∂‡∏Å ‡∏Å‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡∏à‡∏∞‡∏ñ‡∏∂‡∏á‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏£‡∏°‡∏Å‡πá 2 ‡∏ó‡∏∏‡πà‡∏°‡∏Å‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤ ‡∏û‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏á‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏¢‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏õ‡πã‡∏≤‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏Ñ‡πà‡∏∞ ‡πÅ‡∏ô‡∏∞‡∏ô‡∏≥‡πÇ‡∏£‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏£‡∏° ‡∏Ñ‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏ä‡πà‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏•‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏ó‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏≠‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏ä‡πá‡∏Ñ‡∏≠‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏£‡∏ß‡∏î‡πÄ‡∏£‡πá‡∏ß ‡∏ó‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏≠‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà Request ‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ï‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏õ‡πá‡∏ô‡∏≠‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏î‡∏µ ‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á High Floor Nice View ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏û‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏ß‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏Ç‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏á ‡∏™‡∏∞‡∏≠‡∏≤‡∏î ‡πÅ‡∏ï‡πà‡∏≠‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏ö‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏ô‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏î‡πÉ‡∏ä‡πâ Facility ‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¢ ‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏´‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏°‡∏≤‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πâ‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠ the positives:  beautiful room (had a 2 bedroom on 5th floor) & swimming pool, great view  personal always smiling & friendly (but missing some professionalism)    the negatives:  we had some hair from old customers near the toilet for all our 6 days (the room cleaning was very fast, late on day and superficial  the beautiful swimming pool with the stones can be dangerous when touching them  the most disappointing was the breakfast!.

41,"WINDMILL RESORT HOTEL - Prices & Reviews (Pattaya, Thailand) - Tripadvisor","Nice and friendly people working here.  The bad things here is first we paid for rooms with city view but rooms we got had only window to our toilet. rooms where dark with no windows and very bad smell of septics. we asked to change the rooms and first they spray the rooms and it didn't help so got change the rooms but we had to pay extra for that so we paid 200 baht for each remaining nights for what we actually had paid already for . Moved to this hotel because Loma Hotel was worse than awful. Not a bad budget hotel, staff at reception were lovely and helpful, room fine. Little bar at pool, comfy seats there also to relax in if you get fed up of sun lounges. No tea coffee in room, but we went down the road for breakfast, and girl behind bar at pool will get you a coffee if you ask. Away from main road so no noise which is a bonus. Plenty of restaurants etc around. Nice smaller hotel would recommend In the midst of the bustle (and hustle) of Pattaya this hotel offers a welcome poolside respite form the outside action. Building a bit dated and would benefit from the installation of a lift for its mainly elderly western clients.  No dining facilities apart from a hearty breakfast but good cafes all round especially directly across the road.  Good value, enjoyable experience. windmill resort hotel is probably built at least 50 years ago. as there is no elevator, but only having 3 floors it is not that much of a issue. the room was clean, t.v. didn`t work, but they had free internet so it was no big deal. the hotel is close to many bars and places to eat. although saying this it was very quiet at night, the pool is kept in good shape. we got a 50% discount thru booking.com, so thought it was a good deal for what we paid. but if you didn`t get the discount, i think you could find a more newer hotel for around the same price. we paid 750 baht per night. We stayed here with my wife and toddler to meet my traveling friends from Europe. The hotel building/ facility is old. Rooms are very dark (without natural light) and aircon didn‚Äôt function well at the time. Location is okay though, not at the city center, but no too far. Hotel is a bit dated and overdue for renovation but still represents good value. It is located in a good area close to the shops, cafes and transport. Beer garden with live music is opened every night.  Hotel staff is extremely helpful and nice. Management tries to maintain hotel in a neat condition.Swimming pool, breakfast cafe and bar is a nice addition that makes your stay comfortable enough. Overall Windmill resort hotel is reasonable accommodation to be considered by a budget traveler. Quiet for the time of year, except for overnight coach parties, had the decent sized pool to ourselves on most days, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, when asked various questions.  The hotel rooms are adequate with a double bed and a large single, tv, safe, large closet, and balcony. The rooms are cleaned daily although the bedding is not.  The location is fairly busy with all the pubs, bars, massage, shops, dentists, drug stores, vehicle rent, barbers/hairdressers, although not as busy as beach road leading to walking street.  The baht bus passes along the road frequently to central pattaya, so it is not a problem getting to and from the area.  There is a large car park leading to the hotel which is set back from the busy highway.  All in all it was a pleasant stay. there are hotels dearer and cheaper than the windmill, but ¬£ for ¬£ it is good value, quiet, but near all the entertainment, its worth more than a browse. I have stayed several times -never a dissapointment This gem of a hotel offers a cool oasis in the frenetic buzz of life in Pattaya. The room was excellent, and superbly serviced. The salad dishes on the menus were plentiful and fresh daily. Breakfast had the most extensive choice I personally have come across.  Bad news about the local taxis is that they have suspended the ""meter"" system. too tiresome to haggle every time you have to go on a journey, so songthaew system is still best for getting around.  Lack of a gym was a drawback but back on the good side some sound legal advice and assistance was delivered by a front desk manager whose English language skills were excellent. Most of the time there was no hot water for the shower. The sink only has a single faucet with cold water. The room was windowless although the bathroom had windows. The place is old and worn out and there is no elevator. They do have a nice looking lobby and entrance from the street so the place looks good at first but the room was basically awful. They have a very nice swimming pool and the included breakfast is spartan but OK. They will do omelets at breakfast but no cheese! As is normal in Pataya it's more or less in a red light district but there are plenty of nice places to eat on the street in front of the hotel and it's a major street. Taxis are very expensive in Pataya so learn to take the ""pickup truck"" buses to get around when you can. The blue bus is the one on the street you will use to come and go. The hotel staff will go out on the street with you to tell the driver where you want to go. These buses cost basically nothing but they will try to make you pay a lot more if you let them so make sure the price is right before you board. Down by the massage place on the ground floor they sell cokes for only 15 baht! Good deal! just stayed here only for 2 nights the resort was good but far from beach & shopping, the AC din work properly in our room as soon as we called they fixed it !!!! room service was done on time,breakfast was awesome  front desk was very helpful had stayed before and was super this time so disapoiting I cancelled 5 night stay,after 2 nights,was upgrade to pool view (due to booked room have broken shower,broken tv ,and blood on sheets......the pool rooms are dire no blackout curtains for morning bright sun(you can read newspaper through the curtains)the Chinese gather outside from 600 am making nois ebefor there feeding frenzy(breakfast,which is Asian and to avoid)told the staff about noise they just laugh ,,,,,then at night you have same they sit pool chairs and eat midnight feats (yet there are signs every where no outside food and they hotel staff join in)pool is great and always empty as hotel is 95%chinese they go on bus trips so you peace and quites for 8 hours before they come back If you buy a drink at the 7/11 or family mart and drink it around the pool, you will be approached for a 300 baht charge, but this only seems to happen if you are from England or Australia, pool is dirty, staff don't understand you when it is convenient, food is poor, staff that do understand English are patronising, the hotel is feels like there are many traps to charge you money, for example there are charges if your bath or beech towels go missing but the first day I had my room cleaned all my towels were gone and I had no clean ones, there is what looks like an ashtray in the toilet but if you leave a fag in it you will be charged 1000 baht, this hotel with small changes could be good but it is badly managed. The tables around the pool are very dirty, I have been to pattaya about 12 times I have stayed in cheap hotels 50% of the time as I will be on a budget I don't expect extra charges constantly, eventually I refused to spend any money in the hotel on it's services which means ultimately the hotel lost out due to it's hidden costs. I booked for the family, 2 adults and 1 child through Hotels.com and paid for it ahead. When we arrive we still have to pay 500thb for our daughter. We tried to talk to them, said we already paid for her but they refused to cooperate.  I rang Hotels.com but they just kept on telling me that maybe i can get a refund but only maybe.  So tiring that you cant trust such a big hotel page.    The room is alright but balcony is just a 2 metre high wall. Beer and food is at a good price at the hotel. Outside is a few stripper bars but also many shops, restaurants and other hotels.    Probably wont book here again. a friend booked us this hotel as a present(last minute during X-mas) and I must stay not worth it.They gave us a free upgrade because our first room smelled terrible. Located far from everything breakfast below average. return visit after 3 years the rooms are now great new tvs,strong wifi ,aand very clean,the breakfast is still same poor fare(unless your Chinese)eggs and toast only for Europeans,,,where as the chinesse get 10-12 choices ,,,why the discrimination (hotel answer please) .the staff are friendly and happy,pool is great and in the sun all day no shade,,,,price was good but it is low season and very empty ,,lets see what happens come november We traveled to pattaya for first time,in May 2014,and. I want say you that,this hotel needs repair,if you have a room on 3th stage you must go many step to arrive your room,and this is very tiresome,hotel need elevator!!!!!in the room if you have a bath in front of pool and your window shading is not work,outside people see your body and this is very bad,some of the man working in hotel is not good behaviour,the hotel is far from walking street,i only spoke about negative aspects of hotel and this is not moral.the hotel has good staff,example the ladies in reception,they had good behaviour with smile,specially (LIZA),that the best staff in hotel,that speak english very good,she helps passengers,the score i gave her is number 1,with many star ,;-) .we have many problem in pattaya and when speak with lisa forget the problem,she always smile .the wifi speed is very high,the poolside view is very beautifull.totally the score i gave this hotel is average.... i travel around the world and when i came to this hotel with my friends , i was so happy because i was satisfied with the service. I always look and observed the reception area and one of the lady liza speaks good english and always smile . Almost all the guest likes talking to her and asking for some help, she was very helpful i've seen that she also help one of the guest who fall down because of too much drinking. Some of my friends came back and they also said the same thing thanks liza for your great help and your service in this hotel is excellent. value for money....staff is good.food was ok...rooms were of good size....there is a big parking area...the lobby is big and spacious.location is nice...a 20mins walking distance from the beach.the market area is nearby. The reception area with its rusting security boxes behind the reception desk shows this is an old hotel badly in need of renovation. My room, a good size, but was also very dated in a strange green colour with matching painted refrigerator (horrible).    The bathroom was on the whole outside wall of the hotel with an internal window to allow some natural light, very odd design.    A special mention of the main staircase where some of the steps are of an uneven height, even I tripped up on them and I am an active man. The staircase to the top floor is barred with a metal barrier because you can see that the hotel was never finished.    The swimming pool area is actually quite pleasant, a good place to relax and it was also nice to have a good breakfast there. Be warned the pool is deep.    I was told that the bedrooms overlooking the pool area have been refurbished and are the best ones in the hotel.    Overall a hotel badly in need of renovation. I came to Windmill first time in 2003 and have spent 2-6 weeks there every year since. What I like most about this place is the big swimmingpool. In my first years, with the priveous manager, I was allowed to bring two ladies to party in the pool around the clock. And in 2012 it was still possible to go for a swim alone at night, whish I like. The present mangager may not be as casual as the previous, but she is a very nice smiling lady who sent a basket of fruit to my room and whished me welcome home when she saw I was a returning costumer. The internet conection is not perfect, but who cares, on a holyday we are not suposed to be atached to a machine. The rooms are old, but clean and perfectly functional. There may not be to much power on the shower, but definitely enough to remain clean every day. And I soon became friend with the friendly maids who did a good job. The reception staff was a bit stiff on my last stay (sep.2012). Especially the youngest girl, but also she smiled from time to time. The greatest person in Windmill is beyond any doubth the belly boy, whish always smile and is up for a good talk, and is very helpful, I really hope he will be there on me my next visit to Windmill. We have just returned home after over 2 weeks at this ""resort"". First the good bits the daytime pool menu was quite extensive and very good value, the price of food and drinks didn't differ much from outside bars. That is it !!! The rooms were hardly cleaned during the whole stay even though the maid came in daily. The bedding was appalling when there really was no excuse with the amount of cheap laundries everywhere. The reception staff were not helpful in the least and communication with was impossible I asked for a beer one night and was pointed out to a local bar or the shop across the road, considering there was a wide range of international guests staying the common language seemed to be Thai, The photos are a joke we were staying in a superior room and they certainly didn't match anything we had seen.  My wife wanted to take some photos of the sheets and general decor of the room but I just wanted to forget the whole experience and pretend we had never been there. As you can guess by now I won't be recommended this hotel and if you have booked please cancel and find other accommodation, you have to wonder why they have free cancellations now you know. This was my second stay here October 2011. I was booked in a standard room for just under 3 weeks. The Standard rooms are a bit grim but you get what you pay for which does'nt bother me. But on arrival i noticed the pool was out of action. It was for my whole stay. So i managed to get a room upgrade to the deluxe garden rooms. They are a lot better than the standard rooms nice decor and bright. I was very happy with this deal. The staff are friendly and helpful plus they remember me from my last stay. The best rooms are the pool access rooms but are expensive. There are bars and resturants close by on Naklua Road. You can get a taxi (pick up) to walking Street they go past the hotel allday just flag one down. This is a lady friendly hotel so no charge! I will stay here again i enjoyed my time here. Strongly unrecommend.  Too small room. No ventilation-fan in the bathroom which is very small.  Good location but the hotel is not new at all and no elevator.  The room pics are better than real ones in my opinion. Room has some kind of smells so I have to buy odorless air-refresher and use my own bed sheets.    Nice bellboy and housemaid but very lousy reception girl. Cheap, central, clean, friendly staff. Really wanted to give 5 stars particularly with the price to quality thing but I cant. They took our booking knowing the pool was in renovation and would be for a month and we receivid no discount or real sympathy for the inconvenience and when it was 'fixed' it was apparent that the reason it broke in the first place is that it is a chemical pool with no filter so even when it is working, or available, it still is not as good as the pools in other resorts and has bits floating in it. We staying there myn wife and me january 2011 we booked for two weeks but stay only for 2 nights .What a terribele hotel the rooms some one are renovate but small.  The swimming pool old and a few verry old sunbeds.  The brakfast is outstanding nothing the service on the breakfast is outstanding nothing  So if you want ceap and no care than is yoy place this hotel rate 2star.I will nevver go tehr again. I stayed for 20 nights in february 2011. They did me a deal because of my long stay, i got a standard room for 600 baht a night instead of the 750 baht charge. The room was fine, plenty of space double bed, sat tv, fridge, aircon which worked great really kept the room cool except when the cleaners turned it off, but is was remote control so u dont have to get out of bed. The bathroom was fine but the shower was not very powerful and it never had hot water at night, i think everbody use the hot water before going out early evening. You also get 2 free bottles of water a day to put in your fridge. I think i was the only english person in the hotel the majority were russian and german and they took all the sunbeds everyday around the pool, so i never used it. But i never got out of bed till the afternoon anyway the cleaners woke me up the first few days then they got used to me and didnt bother again. The walls are thin you can hear the other rooms and the corridor when people come back late at night. This is a lady friendly hotel they do not charge a joiner fee! The staff are very friendly and helpful. I can say i will be staying here again and i recommend it to others. The Windmill Resort has very clean and nice rooms, is located in the midth of the german/austrian quarter of Pattaya and although it is located next to the Naklua Rd. (much traffic) is a rather quiet place. From the pool you hear some street noise but the rooms facing the opposite side are quiet enough. The have free WIFI Internet which works fine. Compared to their room rates it is a good bargain! This place is very so-so. Nothing bad exactly but...good for older people I think. The rooms had been remodeled and the balcony was OK. The pool area is pretty large. The fron of the hotel is very characterless and lets face it, Naklua isn't the best part of this town. The internet worked sporadically. The staff were OK. The breakfast was the worst-just terrible- but near me there was an older couple wolfing it down and raving about it. Every stuff in the hotel is gentle and friendly.You can easy find thai massage, pubs and shows in nearby areas; middle level in my opinion, maybe because of located in Pattaya, the price is little bit higher than it worth. good hotel with very friendly and helpfull staff  free internet very good,and a nice allround hotel for the money, set in a good part of naklua, close to everything you need in pattaya!!  everywhere only a short bath bus ride away  i would stay here again because of the above reasons and i had such a great stay at windmill resort!! The hotel is very near in shopping area.Acessible for the transportation.The servicce is good.The room is clean and quite.It is very nice place for those who want night life. i really love this hotel, for the whole time that i spent at the hotel i felt so relax and felt like home because of the staff as well they are so nice    great!! windmill rules!!!","https://maps.google.com/maps/api/staticmap?&channel=ta.desktop.hotel_review&zoom=13&size=803x241&scale=1&client=gme-tripadvisorinc&format=jpg&sensor=false&language=en_US&center=12.971916,100.904854&maptype=roadmap&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fresponsive_map_pins_v2%2FH_Anchor_pin.png|12.971916,100.904854&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FA_Pin_xs.png|12.973813,100.906319|12.973932,100.907280|12.967360,100.899460|12.971680,100.904800|12.969510,100.906929|12.972208,100.912155&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FR_Pin_xs.png|12.969304,100.895462|12.978675,100.911247|12.978750,100.911346|12.968847,100.901031|12.969087,100.895523|12.967360,100.899460|12.974465,100.907814|12.969820,100.904823|12.973379,100.909355&&markers=icon:http%3A%2F%2Fc1.tacdn.com%2F%2Fimg2%2Fmaps%2Ficons%2Fcomponent_map_pins_v1%2FH_Pin_xs.png|12.962569,100.907356|12.974410,100.908669|12.969748,100.899918|12.970997,100.895470|12.972500,100.893929|12.962568,100.909744|12.968396,100.895966|12.975434,100.913986|12.971354,100.893837&signature=xMeKMSz1QhXWlbA07sOUKyMjXGE=",1.0,Positive
42,"Z BY ZING $11 ($Ã∂1Ã∂9Ã∂) - Prices & Specialty Hotel Reviews - Jomtien Beach, Pattaya - Tripadvisor","'Z BY ZING', is an honest place to stay, most particularly for the budget and location conscious, tourist spending time in lovely Jomtien Beach. I really enjoyed the flexible attitude to reasonable service requests, as well as the quiet acoustics and expanded space, in my studio room. It is an easy, flat, five (5) minute walk to the beach, with heaps of; dining, drinking, entertainment, shopping and spa places (see my YouTube), occupying the surrounds. It was good hotel. Location is little bit behind from beach . But , As compare to price that‚Äôs good . The staff of hotel are also good and polite . I would recommend to all those whose are looking for cheap and best stay .    Thanks & Regards  Uppal 200 metres from Jomtien Beach, cheap, big room, smiles and service. I needed the internet to be good for some work on holiday. Had a problem (one they had never had before....my problem, not the internet) and the staff went ‚Äúover the top‚Äù to try to help. In the end, changing our room so we could access a different service at the hotel. And it worked perfectly! Thankyou ‚ÄúZingers‚Äù! this hotel met all my expectations. It was clean , big rooms , fridge , coffee making facilities in a lovely local neigbourhood close to beach. Was real value for money and those who complain don't have any reason to This hotel is a dive i wouldnt stay here if i got paid i booked this hotel from reading review since my inlaws needed a place to stay for a few days while my wife and i stayed at another hotel close by. They got a room on the roof yes on the roof apparently they had taken down the roof and build extra rooms up there AC could not cool the room the wall was thinner than a pancake and it had a smell of paint that made you feel dizzy. The location is also bad its in an ally with bad lighting just the place where you expect to get robbed or worse. When we confronted the receptionist she said this kind of hotel is not one you book in advance or even for a longer period its from ppl walking in from the street wanting to stay one night ( Like the sort of place you would take a prostiture i imagine maybe thats why it get good reviews ? ) anyway we got our money back and found another hotel. The 2nd of our stopovers on our 3 month trip to SE Asia. Well situated about halfway along the beach Road Jomtien. Two minute walk from hotel to beach itself. Staff helpful and pleasnt enough. Free coffee tea etc at reception. Room spotless, modern and well equipped, again with beverage making facilities.  Big positive: wifi excellent and continuous; price less than 600 baht per night  Big negative: shower tepid. Had to use kettle to shave. No room view.  Lift available  Recommendedüëçüëç The hotel is horrible... The rooms have bad mold that you cannot breathe...the WiFi did not work as described... I got my refund by Expedia as they understood my issues...and still debating for cash reservation was done for a previous night...really horrible experience...also I added pictures of insects with cocoons on the walls that are not cleaned...the worse is the mold...had to open the sliding door that made the room full of mosquitoes... This hotel had lot of fines like if towel gets dirty there is a fine etc... we were allotted 2 rooms at 5th floor both the rooms AC was not working.... hotel is far from main road. Just opposite to this hotel you can rent 2 wheeler which was good....beach is also nearby.... I have stayed here on a number of occasions. The rooms are reasonably priced, basic but very clean and comfortable. The staff are friendly and it is about a 5 minute walk down to the beach. It is quite far south in Jomtien, however, you can get the Songthaew / Baht bus for 10 baht anywhere in Jomtien. Plenty of dining options nearby and also down on the seafront.    On my last visit I did have a number of problems with the Wifi. On previous visits, the wifi worked well but on quite a few occasions I could not get online. I would suggest they try to fix this. I booked two rooms in this hotel through booking.com after reading the reviews in tripadvisor.com and I was not disappointed. The place is modern, clean and convenient for the beach and -most of all- very cheap. After a week there, we decided to stay 10 days more. The rooms are big, the wifi excellent, the aircon. the tv, the bathroom, the safe, the fridge, everything was perfect. the only draw back is that it is at the end of Jomtien soi 12 and you need to walk 5' to reach the main road or the beach. There is no breakfast or coffee shop, but they have a coffee machine at the lobby working free every morning: basic but very good place. Although the rooms are all non-smoking (which is good), they have a couple of tables at the porch where you can have a cup of coffee smoking a fag. Simple, basic, clean, convenient and very cheap: we paid an average of $15 per room per day. Recommended. We stayed here for 4 days, first night my bed wasn't to comfortable so I spoke to reception and within 10 minute they put a mattress topper on. This made the bed outstanding. The hotel is super clean, the cleaners are very friendly. The pools are clean, top deck pool is pretty over looking the city. One thing I didn't like is the Indians were all swimming in there pants, and this does really annoy me cause it's just the dirtiest of things. Maybe staff could tell me shorts need to be worn. Apart from that could not fault a single thing we loved our stay, and this place is worth more then what they charge, we paid 2,700 for 4 days. Very very cheap but great place. Did arrived there around 3pm there, room was ready.  Check in went quite ok without real greetings as well any welcome amenities as a simple glass of juice or fresh water. No information provided about the room and property.  Room 401 is quite ok, big enough for 2 persons but not really well cleaned. Food or brownish stains on white walls in the room as well plenty of toothpaste spots around the sink in the bathroom, sliding room is a kind of mouldy/rusty and doesn't give a good impression about hygiene. Good water pressure as well hot water was ok enough. Limited foreigner TV channels, small fried, safety deposit box locked, asked to open it but never happened...  Plenty of plugs around the room, wifi was ok and not always stable....  In conclusion nothing extraordinary or to make it wow.  Pictures are better than the reality...  Few long Asian lady hair on the floor closed to the bed too who is a big turn off for me without being picky.... The staff working there are not very nice or friendly. But the hotel is 5 minutes from the beach and restaurants. The rooms are pretty clean but the toilet was a problem. The shower pressure was very strong and the toilet seat was a yellowish stain like colour. We were out all day and basically stayed the night so wasn't as bad. The place is ok to stay the night. If you're looking for a clean yet budget friendly hotel Z by Zing is the place for you. Not fancy but clean and the staff wonderful. The location is 1 Block from the beach and the Baht Bus that can take you to Jontiem Beach or into town for less than a cup of coffee. If you're looking for fancy hotel look elsewhere but I give it a 10 for cleanliness, convenience and quietness. The behaviour of staff was rude. A guy named Aon Chanamon behaved as if he was the king and we were his servants. On asking for cups for coffee, he started shouting at us and said that we can bring cups from our rooms if we need any coffee. Don't know how such poor hospitality gets such good reviews on Tripadvisor. I'm glad we only stay 4 hours at this budget hotel , due have to go back for work in BKK next day. room was okay for its price per night. 486 baht , small cockroaches we found but it's okay since we just stay for hours. but receptionist i can't miss to mentioned here. we kindly ask reception if we can have a new towel due the towel in the room we have used is dirty and not in good condition towels it's like a rag though, but 2 Guys and 1 lady receptionist insist that they will not change because we stay only 1 night, but i insist that will just stay for 4 hours besides the towel they provide is like a rag , so the woman (receptionist) says that she will going to change just for us in a very bad sarcastic way and bring to the room , but until we check out there's no towels deliver in the room. Three days at this hotel. Overall fine and nice experience. Very near to beach and public transport to other places is accessible. Pleasant and peaceful place with silence all over. Food restaurants are very near, you can roam around the beach even at nights Room very large and roomy clean and modern, staff friendly and welcoming few minutes walk from beach and restaurants. Approx 20min by car to central  Pattaya through traffic so a bit out of the way if you don't have transport. Would recommend hotel. The room is big enough, clean and tidy.    It's located about 500m from Jomtien Beach Road and is very quiet. Nothing close by to cause too much noise.    There is complimentary coffee in reception and tea (40 baht), not sure if you have to pay for the toast. It would be awesome if they could provide filter coffee.    This is a budget hotel and the location bears this out. There doesn't appear to be any rooms with a view. The reception front is opposite a car park. My room has the view of the side of another hotel. Not the type hotel where you can laze around if you didn't want to go sight-seeing. Staff of Z by Zing is topping the overall package. A clean, well maintained place. At the heart of Jomtien beach but laid back enough to avoid the noise of the beach road traffic. A good stay for a night or a couple of days at this destination. Not five star luxury - but always a five star smile! The staff couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating. A boutique hotel on a quiet street with 42 rooms. We had a deluxe room on the ground floor which was very comfortable for a Canadian senior couple. This is a 6 floor hotel with an elevator. Everything very clean...highly recommended. Beach, small stores and laundry within easy walk. Stayed one night only.  Pro:  - personnel was friendly and helpful indeed  - cleanness  - puple decor  - fast wifi    Contra:  - location (ok, but among incompleted constraction)  - room at ground floor was a bit dark. It is a very nice and comfortable hotel. Although, far from the main city center yet well connected with public transportation. The rooms are very comfortable and staffs are also nice. In hotel they take 500Bhat as a security money and it is returned during checkout time. Young staff, very nice people, great price, super clean room, excellent bed, small to medium size room. I'd say pretty also, but that's taste. Coffee available all the time. Guess it depends on what you like, so people who complain it's not near the crowded downtown glitzy part of Pattaya are right. But me and my lady friend (we're a 50's and 60's age group) just loved it. A five minute or less walk to very nice beach, quiet at the end of deserted street for us was fine. Wonderful inexpensive delicious restaurant right around the corner. Incredibly inexpensive, well run, not fancy, but what do you need for a romantic little vacation besides a beautiful beach with hawkers offering you fresh pineapple and mangoes every few minutes for a pittance, and a quiet safe room. And a great name to remember, Z by Zing, my friend and I laugh about it when we think of it! If you are on a budget then this is a great choice. 200m off the main beach road this is a cheap hotel. i got a big room on the second floor, comfortable bed, decent bathroom. Internet was included and I paid just 550bt. Beware though the stairs are steep inside, go in the lift!! We have booked for two rooms, double and triple occupancy. The hotel close with the beach, but we have to used tuk tuk to go to Pattaya City and Walking Street. In generally, the rooms very clean and enjoyed our stay here. But wifi not working enough, sometimes can be used, sometimes cannot connected. The hotel overall is very good & clean. We saw the rate at 8 so decided to stay into this hotel. But very disappointed at the location.It was far from the Pattaya city or walking street. When you need to walk back to your hotel, you need to walk through a short distance which would spent you about 2 mins from the main road. It was near to the under~construction property. The noise is very terrible and make us leave the room as soon as possible. writing the review a year later but per latest reviews, it still seems relavant.  stayed here in July 2015.    This is a very clean place. The rooms are clean, the bedding is good, the toilets and shower is good. Also it costs around 500THB that is super cool. Free wifi. No in-house kitchen.    This hotel is on the quieter Jomtien beach area and hence far from all actions.But you can always -any time- walk to the main road and take a shared tempo-songtaew- and reach anywhere in just 10THB per head.    Jomtien beach is just 2 mins walk...so you can take stroll or just sit on the beaches in the night.    Overall, a very good place to stay and well within budget. (but if your are a gang of boys willing to spend to stay closer to walking street...then dont choose jomtien beach area...or this hotel)    No views from your window unless you take the topmost floor. Stay here on my recent visit to pattaya, i found this property on booking.com on 8.0 rating, therefore i thought this would be a good choice, but it turn out to be the opposite for me.    Here's the pros of the hotel:  1. It's cheap, it cost much cheaper than any other hotel in pattaya.  2. It's clean, yes i say its clean. The rooms are well kept, no stains on bedsheets or toilets.  3. The Shower is good. The water rush on these showers are really good!  4. Wifi is super fast! I was happy with it!  5. This place is quite, away from the clubs and bars, at night it can be very deserted.    Here's the cons, as per my review. If you are a party goers, looking for entertainment then it's a big no for you! Here's why i said so:  1. The Location! It's way too far from the central pattaya or walking street! These part of pattaya (jomtien) is a bit laidback, thr's not much entertainment here and everytime you wnt to go to walking street 'sontheaw' ride cost between 150bt to 200bt. So you still lose the money you save on the hotel rate!  2. The surrounding is no good. This part of the town is on construction site, or these buildings are abandoned! So i can get abit frightening at night. But no problems, just that its on deserted place.  3. The rooms has rules, they will charge you not only for damage but also for dirty! Therefore if you stay here, then you got to be very very careful with their stuff.  4. Door has Gaps! Doors when closed has got gaps in between, if there's anyone whom tried to peep, i believe they can see!    I would not come here back, simply because of the location. Rather pay abit more and stay in places near central pattaya. One of the favourite hotel we stayed in Thailand. Lovely environment. The place is clean and beautiful. Nearby to Jomtien Beach, local restaurants and massage centers. Staffs speak English. It made easy to communicte with them. Worth an experience. Loved it! This place is a little off the beaten path which can be both good and bad. The bad is that you are away from all the 'action' in the Jomtien/Pattaya area which can be good on it's own, and the good part is that if you want a nice quiet place to be that is super reasonable then you have found it. It's about the equivalent of 2-3 blocks from the beach so it's just a short stroll to get there. Or take a passing songtow and head off to the Night Market or Rampoo market for some great street food for next to nothing. While the rooms can seem a little sparse from Western standards and there really isn't any view from the rooms, this isn't where I spent my waking hours. Good place to just come back to and get cleaned up so you can head back out and get some food (and maybe a beer). I really like this hotel the rooms are nice and clean. The staff are very friendly and speak good English. The hotel is close to the beach and local restaurants. The price is very good if you are looking for a budget hotel then check this place out. I was looking for a cheap place to spend one night before moving on from Jomtien Beach... This achieves that goal. The first thing you notice about the room is how big it is. It's massive. BUT with all this space there ia very little you can do with it, one small couch, a bed and a writers table try to soak up the vast space but fail. Its got a ""white"" theme going on with a ton of lights in the ceiling that amplify the rooms whiteness when turned on. Its just not my cup of tea. You wont get that romantic golden glow here. But the price is low, its clean and appears safe. Location is ok. = central Jomtien behind the main street. 1 minute walk to the beach. Z by Zing is hidden in the end of a blind ally with hostels and industry as neighbours. It's not a nice neighbourhood but it also means you are a distance from the noisy cars in the busy street.  My room was clean but very impersonal. Not a cosy room. The doors had really big openings around it and it was tried fixed with rubber bands but without mentionable success! I could look out into the hallway. Both light and noise came through easily at night.  Staff was polite and helpful. But the shower was fantastic! Loads of water and as hot as you wanted it from the large shower head.  The beach is not very far away but I never went to stay there.  Along the busy street there are lots of sale booths. Everything from fresh fruit, street food, travel agencies and various souvenirs. From the Zing family.  I stayed in 3 hotels of their chain, this one was the one I liked the least, but still good for what you paid.    Welcome at the reception was cold, room was nice and bright.  Some details however could easily be ameliorated though (coffee bags in room were forgotten, coffee cups still dirty).  Location nog far from the bracht but the other Zing-hotel in Pattaya is beter located in my opinion.    All in all very decent for what you pay. The hotel is nice and comfortable. Near to jomtien beach but not so near to central Pattaya. It has all the basic amenities like wifi, t.v., fridge etc. Overall, a good stay and can be recommended to other guests who wish to stay at a quieter place. We were really pleasantly surprised when we arrived at this hotel. We booked a superior double room for two weeks over Christmas & new year, and could happily have stayed longer. The location is perfect; right near the beach and still set back from the noise of the main road. 10 baht buses will run you anywhere in the area from this main road. Everything in the room worked and nothing leaked, which was a real difference from the other places we've stayed in Thailand. Inside the room was spotless, but the balcony was constantly grubby. It was quiet at night, but we were woken early most mornings by the building work next door, which we disappointingly hadn't been forewarned about. Building started around 7:30am most mornings and was hard to sleep through in our room, but maybe some rooms are quieter than others. They sell tea, coffee and toast in the foyer, and there is a 30 baht washing machine right outside the hotel if their laundry prices are a little pricey for you (like they were for us). The staff were not that brilliant, but not in any way rude; I think they were maybe just shy as their English was a little limited. Everyone apart from the manager just seemed to ignore us completely, unless we approached them first. Aircon and WiFi worked well. The bed was hard but no worse than the rest of Thailand. I highly recommend this hotel! The room is clean.. New hotel, so the property is great. It has a refrigerator in the room. Nice staff, i got so many helps of the direction from them..  But the lift only take to 5th floor.. I got the 6th floor, so i have to take a stair.  Over all, it was so great place to take a rest.. Basic budget hotel. Rooms are undoubtedly big and everything else is very basic.Can't expect much with such pricing. The hotel however expect a deposit of 1000 bath upon check in.    Room: The room does have a safe but the size is about 6 X 4 inches so it is not very useful. The room doors are still using the conventional type of locking system so it is rather easy to prise open which made me feel rather insecure. There were on going construction work going on outside so by 9am I was totally awake by the natural alarm clock.    Staff: The staff, they are not very well versed in almost everything because whatever I ask I only got a yes, no or I don't know answer.    Location: The hotel location is really hard to find even for the locals so had to use another hotel as a landmark for cabs. The vicinity of the hotel don't really serve much food however if anyone is willing to walk about 500m there are some food stalls outside.    Wifi: the hotel provide encrypted wifi and the stability was ok.    Conclusion: This hotel has nothing to shout about but well for a budget hotel I guess it'll suffice. I am Thai tourist. This is my first time travelling in Pattaya alone. Z by Zing is so great about the price, cleanliness, service-minded staff. I paid around 480 baht per night through Expedia which it really worth staying here. I am so impressed about the super clean new room with the fridge. You can walk to the Jom-tien beach in 5 minutes. You can also find laudromat near there. At first, I planned to stay for a night but I extended to 3 nights. Thank you for good stay ^^ great hotel,pro staff,very helpful.clean rooms,great location 100 meters from the beach.a bit out of nightlife and bars but if you want to sleep at night it is perfect.good for long term,business travelers or couples. If you are into staying at places that are down to earth simple, Z by Zing is it. No breakfast, excellent staff and showers and a very comfortable and quiet setting setting to sleep. And the price is great to boot. -We stay in Standard double ded.  -Good location (walk to Jomtien beach in 4 minute and Family Mart just around the corner)  -New Hotel.  -Nice Facility. (Flat Screen TV / Safe / Refrigerator / Writing desk / Electric kettle)  -Friendly Staff  -Budget hotel  -Room not very big but okay and value for money.  -Key Deposit 500 Baht Similar to that shown in photos provided here on tripadvisor. Neat and clean with friendly staff. English speaking is an exeption not a rule. They dont give bike on rent but there is a hostel on the opposite site owned by a european person i guess from where you can rent bike. Quite near to the beach and family mart. This brand new Hotel is the third Zing Hotel in Pattaya /Jomtien . This little brother on the beach road from the famous Jomtien Beach near Soi 12 is a brand new Hotel . It is the typical Zing style -the same as Zing PP and Zing in Pattaya . This Hotel has to grow ofcourse but it is very clean - very chaep and 40 meters from the sea. So ideal for backpackers and the people with a small wallet . Big rooms and flatscreens - one of the best in the busgetclass. And nice foreign and thai staff always smiling - Important. 'Z BY ZING', is an honest place to stay, most particularly for the budget and location conscious, tourist spending time in lovely Jomtien Beach. I really enjoyed the flexible attitude to reasonable service requests, as well as the quiet acoustics and expanded space, in my studio room. It is an easy, flat, five (5) minute walk to the beach, with heaps of; dining, drinking, entertainment, shopping and spa places (see my YouTube), occupying the surrounds. It was good hotel. Location is little bit behind from beach . But , As compare to price that‚Äôs good . The staff of hotel are also good and polite . I would recommend to all those whose are looking for cheap and best stay .    Thanks & Regards  Uppal 200 metres from Jomtien Beach, cheap, big room, smiles and service. I needed the internet to be good for some work on holiday. Had a problem (one they had never had before....my problem, not the internet) and the staff went ‚Äúover the top‚Äù to try to help. In the end, changing our room so we could access a different service at the hotel. And it worked perfectly! Thankyou ‚ÄúZingers‚Äù! this hotel met all my expectations. It was clean , big rooms , fridge , coffee making facilities in a lovely local neigbourhood close to beach. Was real value for money and those who complain don't have any reason to This hotel is a dive i wouldnt stay here if i got paid i booked this hotel from reading review since my inlaws needed a place to stay for a few days while my wife and i stayed at another hotel close by. They got a room on the roof yes on the roof apparently they had taken down the roof and build extra rooms up there AC could not cool the room the wall was thinner than a pancake and it had a smell of paint that made you feel dizzy. The location is also bad its in an ally with bad lighting just the place where you expect to get robbed or worse. When we confronted the receptionist she said this kind of hotel is not one you book in advance or even for a longer period its from ppl walking in from the street wanting to stay one night ( Like the sort of place you would take a prostiture i imagine maybe thats why it get good reviews ? ) anyway we got our money back and found another hotel. The 2nd of our stopovers on our 3 month trip to SE Asia. Well situated about halfway along the beach Road Jomtien. Two minute walk from hotel to beach itself. Staff helpful and pleasnt enough. Free coffee tea etc at reception. Room spotless, modern and well equipped, again with beverage making facilities.  Big positive: wifi excellent and continuous; price less than 600 baht per night  Big negative: shower tepid. Had to use kettle to shave. No room view.  Lift available  Recommendedüëçüëç The hotel is horrible... The rooms have bad mold that you cannot breathe...the WiFi did not work as described... I got my refund by Expedia as they understood my issues...and still debating for cash reservation was done for a previous night...really horrible experience...also I added pictures of insects with cocoons on the walls that are not cleaned...the worse is the mold...had to open the sliding door that made the room full of mosquitoes... This hotel had lot of fines like if towel gets dirty there is a fine etc... we were allotted 2 rooms at 5th floor both the rooms AC was not working.... hotel is far from main road. Just opposite to this hotel you can rent 2 wheeler which was good....beach is also nearby.... I have stayed here on a number of occasions. The rooms are reasonably priced, basic but very clean and comfortable. The staff are friendly and it is about a 5 minute walk down to the beach. It is quite far south in Jomtien, however, you can get the Songthaew / Baht bus for 10 baht anywhere in Jomtien. Plenty of dining options nearby and also down on the seafront.    On my last visit I did have a number of problems with the Wifi. On previous visits, the wifi worked well but on quite a few occasions I could not get online. I would suggest they try to fix this. I booked two rooms in this hotel through booking.com after reading the reviews in tripadvisor.com and I was not disappointed. The place is modern, clean and convenient for the beach and -most of all- very cheap. After a week there, we decided to stay 10 days more. The rooms are big, the wifi excellent, the aircon. the tv, the bathroom, the safe, the fridge, everything was perfect. the only draw back is that it is at the end of Jomtien soi 12 and you need to walk 5' to reach the main road or the beach. There is no breakfast or coffee shop, but they have a coffee machine at the lobby working free every morning: basic but very good place. Although the rooms are all non-smoking (which is good), they have a couple of tables at the porch where you can have a cup of coffee smoking a fag. Simple, basic, clean, convenient and very cheap: we paid an average of $15 per room per day. Recommended. We stayed here for 4 days, first night my bed wasn't to comfortable so I spoke to reception and within 10 minute they put a mattress topper on. This made the bed outstanding. The hotel is super clean, the cleaners are very friendly. The pools are clean, top deck pool is pretty over looking the city. One thing I didn't like is the Indians were all swimming in there pants, and this does really annoy me cause it's just the dirtiest of things. Maybe staff could tell me shorts need to be worn. Apart from that could not fault a single thing we loved our stay, and this place is worth more then what they charge, we paid 2,700 for 4 days. Very very cheap but great place. Did arrived there around 3pm there, room was ready.  Check in went quite ok without real greetings as well any welcome amenities as a simple glass of juice or fresh water. No information provided about the room and property.  Room 401 is quite ok, big enough for 2 persons but not really well cleaned. Food or brownish stains on white walls in the room as well plenty of toothpaste spots around the sink in the bathroom, sliding room is a kind of mouldy/rusty and doesn't give a good impression about hygiene. Good water pressure as well hot water was ok enough. Limited foreigner TV channels, small fried, safety deposit box locked, asked to open it but never happened...  Plenty of plugs around the room, wifi was ok and not always stable....  In conclusion nothing extraordinary or to make it wow.  Pictures are better than the reality...  Few long Asian lady hair on the floor closed to the bed too who is a big turn off for me without being picky.... The staff working there are not very nice or friendly. But the hotel is 5 minutes from the beach and restaurants. The rooms are pretty clean but the toilet was a problem. The shower pressure was very strong and the toilet seat was a yellowish stain like colour. We were out all day and basically stayed the night so wasn't as bad. The place is ok to stay the night. If you're looking for a clean yet budget friendly hotel Z by Zing is the place for you. Not fancy but clean and the staff wonderful. The location is 1 Block from the beach and the Baht Bus that can take you to Jontiem Beach or into town for less than a cup of coffee. If you're looking for fancy hotel look elsewhere but I give it a 10 for cleanliness, convenience and quietness. The behaviour of staff was rude. A guy named Aon Chanamon behaved as if he was the king and we were his servants. On asking for cups for coffee, he started shouting at us and said that we can bring cups from our rooms if we need any coffee. Don't know how such poor hospitality gets such good reviews on Tripadvisor. I'm glad we only stay 4 hours at this budget hotel , due have to go back for work in BKK next day. room was okay for its price per night. 486 baht , small cockroaches we found but it's okay since we just stay for hours. but receptionist i can't miss to mentioned here. we kindly ask reception if we can have a new towel due the towel in the room we have used is dirty and not in good condition towels it's like a rag though, but 2 Guys and 1 lady receptionist insist that they will not change because we stay only 1 night, but i insist that will just stay for 4 hours besides the towel they provide is like a rag , so the woman (receptionist) says that she will going to change just for us in a very bad sarcastic way and bring to the room , but until we check out there's no towels deliver in the room. Three days at this hotel. Overall fine and nice experience. Very near to beach and public transport to other places is accessible. Pleasant and peaceful place with silence all over. Food restaurants are very near, you can roam around the beach even at nights Room very large and roomy clean and modern, staff friendly and welcoming few minutes walk from beach and restaurants. Approx 20min by car to central  Pattaya through traffic so a bit out of the way if you don't have transport. Would recommend hotel. The room is big enough, clean and tidy.    It's located about 500m from Jomtien Beach Road and is very quiet. Nothing close by to cause too much noise.    There is complimentary coffee in reception and tea (40 baht), not sure if you have to pay for the toast. It would be awesome if they could provide filter coffee.    This is a budget hotel and the location bears this out. There doesn't appear to be any rooms with a view. The reception front is opposite a car park. My room has the view of the side of another hotel. Not the type hotel where you can laze around if you didn't want to go sight-seeing. Staff of Z by Zing is topping the overall package. A clean, well maintained place. At the heart of Jomtien beach but laid back enough to avoid the noise of the beach road traffic. A good stay for a night or a couple of days at this destination. Not five star luxury - but always a five star smile! The staff couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating. A boutique hotel on a quiet street with 42 rooms. We had a deluxe room on the ground floor which was very comfortable for a Canadian senior couple. This is a 6 floor hotel with an elevator. Everything very clean...highly recommended. Beach, small stores and laundry within easy walk. Stayed one night only.  Pro:  - personnel was friendly and helpful indeed  - cleanness  - puple decor  - fast wifi    Contra:  - location (ok, but among incompleted constraction)  - room at ground floor was a bit dark. It is a very nice and comfortable hotel. Although, far from the main city center yet well connected with public transportation. The rooms are very comfortable and staffs are also nice. In hotel they take 500Bhat as a security money and it is returned during checkout time. Young staff, very nice people, great price, super clean room, excellent bed, small to medium size room. I'd say pretty also, but that's taste. Coffee available all the time. Guess it depends on what you like, so people who complain it's not near the crowded downtown glitzy part of Pattaya are right. But me and my lady friend (we're a 50's and 60's age group) just loved it. A five minute or less walk to very nice beach, quiet at the end of deserted street for us was fine. Wonderful inexpensive delicious restaurant right around the corner. Incredibly inexpensive, well run, not fancy, but what do you need for a romantic little vacation besides a beautiful beach with hawkers offering you fresh pineapple and mangoes every few minutes for a pittance, and a quiet safe room. And a great name to remember, Z by Zing, my friend and I laugh about it when we think of it! If you are on a budget then this is a great choice. 200m off the main beach road this is a cheap hotel. i got a big room on the second floor, comfortable bed, decent bathroom. Internet was included and I paid just 550bt. Beware though the stairs are steep inside, go in the lift!! We have booked for two rooms, double and triple occupancy. The hotel close with the beach, but we have to used tuk tuk to go to Pattaya City and Walking Street. In generally, the rooms very clean and enjoyed our stay here. But wifi not working enough, sometimes can be used, sometimes cannot connected. The hotel overall is very good & clean. We saw the rate at 8 so decided to stay into this hotel. But very disappointed at the location.It was far from the Pattaya city or walking street. When you need to walk back to your hotel, you need to walk through a short distance which would spent you about 2 mins from the main road. It was near to the under~construction property.

And the price is great to boot. -We stay in Standard double ded.  -Good location (walk to Jomtien beach in 4 minute and Family Mart just around the corner)  -New Hotel.  -Nice Facility. (Flat Screen TV / Safe / Refrigerator / Writing desk / Electric kettle)  -Friendly Staff  -Budget hotel  -Room not very big but okay and value for money.  -Key Deposit 500 Baht Similar to that shown in photos provided here on tripadvisor. Neat and clean with friendly staff. English speaking is an exeption not a rule.

This brand new Hotel is the third Zing Hotel in Pattaya /Jomtien . This little brother on the beach road from the famous Jomtien Beach near Soi 12 is a brand new Hotel . It is the typical Zing style -the same as Zing PP and Zing in Pattaya . This Hotel has to grow ofcourse but it is very clean - very chaep and 40 meters from the sea. So ideal for backpackers and the people with a small wallet . Big rooms and flatscreens - one of the best in the busgetclass. And nice foreign and thai staff always smiling - Important. 'Z BY ZING', is an honest place to stay, most particularly for the budget and location conscious, tourist spending time in lovely Jomtien Beach. I really enjoyed the flexible attitude to reasonable service requests, as well as the quiet acoustics and expanded space, in my studio room. It is an easy, flat, five (5) minute walk to the beach, with heaps of; dining, drinking, entertainment, shopping and spa places (see my YouTube), occupying the surrounds. It was good hotel. Location is little bit behind from beach . But , As compare to price that‚Äôs good . The staff of hotel are also good and polite . I would recommend to all those whose are looking for cheap and best stay .    Thanks & Regards  Uppal 200 metres from Jomtien Beach, cheap, big room, smiles and service. I needed the internet to be good for some work on holiday. Had a problem (one they had never had before....my problem, not the internet) and the staff went ‚Äúover the top‚Äù to try to help. In the end, changing our room so we could access a different service at the hotel. And it worked perfectly! Thankyou ‚ÄúZingers‚Äù! this hotel met all my expectations. It was clean , big rooms , fridge , coffee making facilities in a lovely local neigbourhood close to beach. Was real value for money and those who complain don't have any reason to This hotel is a dive i wouldnt stay here if i got paid i booked this hotel from reading review since my inlaws needed a place to stay for a few days while my wife and i stayed at another hotel close by. They got a room on the roof yes on the roof apparently they had taken down the roof and build extra rooms up there AC could not cool the room the wall was thinner than a pancake and it had a smell of paint that made you feel dizzy. The location is also bad its in an ally with bad lighting just the place where you expect to get robbed or worse. When we confronted the receptionist she said this kind of hotel is not one you book in advance or even for a longer period its from ppl walking in from the street wanting to stay one night ( Like the sort of place you would take a prostiture i imagine maybe thats why it get good reviews ? ) anyway we got our money back and found another hotel. The 2nd of our stopovers on our 3 month trip to SE Asia. Well situated about halfway along the beach Road Jomtien. Two minute walk from hotel to beach itself. Staff helpful and pleasnt enough. Free coffee tea etc at reception. Room spotless, modern and well equipped, again with beverage making facilities.  Big positive: wifi excellent and continuous; price less than 600 baht per night  Big negative: shower tepid. Had to use kettle to shave. No room view.  Lift available  Recommendedüëçüëç The hotel is horrible... The rooms have bad mold that you cannot breathe...the WiFi did not work as described... I got my refund by Expedia as they understood my issues...and still debating for cash reservation was done for a previous night...really horrible experience...also I added pictures of insects with cocoons on the walls that are not cleaned...the worse is the mold...had to open the sliding door that made the room full of mosquitoes... This hotel had lot of fines like if towel gets dirty there is a fine etc... we were allotted 2 rooms at 5th floor both the rooms AC was not working.... hotel is far from main road. Just opposite to this hotel you can rent 2 wheeler which was good....beach is also nearby.... I have stayed here on a number of occasions. The rooms are reasonably priced, basic but very clean and comfortable. The staff are friendly and it is about a 5 minute walk down to the beach. It is quite far south in Jomtien, however, you can get the Songthaew / Baht bus for 10 baht anywhere in Jomtien. Plenty of dining options nearby and also down on the seafront.    On my last visit I did have a number of problems with the Wifi. On previous visits, the wifi worked well but on quite a few occasions I could not get online. I would suggest they try to fix this. I booked two rooms in this hotel through booking.com after reading the reviews in tripadvisor.com and I was not disappointed. The place is modern, clean and convenient for the beach and -most of all- very cheap. After a week there, we decided to stay 10 days more. The rooms are big, the wifi excellent, the aircon. the tv, the bathroom, the safe, the fridge, everything was perfect. the only draw back is that it is at the end of Jomtien soi 12 and you need to walk 5' to reach the main road or the beach. There is no breakfast or coffee shop, but they have a coffee machine at the lobby working free every morning: basic but very good place. Although the rooms are all non-smoking (which is good), they have a couple of tables at the porch where you can have a cup of coffee smoking a fag. Simple, basic, clean, convenient and very cheap: we paid an average of $15 per room per day. Recommended. We stayed here for 4 days, first night my bed wasn't to comfortable so I spoke to reception and within 10 minute they put a mattress topper on. This made the bed outstanding. The hotel is super clean, the cleaners are very friendly. The pools are clean, top deck pool is pretty over looking the city. One thing I didn't like is the Indians were all swimming in there pants, and this does really annoy me cause it's just the dirtiest of things. Maybe staff could tell me shorts need to be worn. Apart from that could not fault a single thing we loved our stay, and this place is worth more then what they charge, we paid 2,700 for 4 days. Very very cheap but great place. Did arrived there around 3pm there, room was ready.  Check in went quite ok without real greetings as well any welcome amenities as a simple glass of juice or fresh water. No information provided about the room and property.  Room 401 is quite ok, big enough for 2 persons but not really well cleaned. Food or brownish stains on white walls in the room as well plenty of toothpaste spots around the sink in the bathroom, sliding room is a kind of mouldy/rusty and doesn't give a good impression about hygiene. Good water pressure as well hot water was ok enough. Limited foreigner TV channels, small fried, safety deposit box locked, asked to open it but never happened...  Plenty of plugs around the room, wifi was ok and not always stable....  In conclusion nothing extraordinary or to make it wow.  Pictures are better than the reality...  Few long Asian lady hair on the floor closed to the bed too who is a big turn off for me without being picky.... The staff working there are not very nice or friendly. But the hotel is 5 minutes from the beach and restaurants. The rooms are pretty clean but the toilet was a problem. The shower pressure was very strong and the toilet seat was a yellowish stain like colour. We were out all day and basically stayed the night so wasn't as bad. The place is ok to stay the night. If you're looking for a clean yet budget friendly hotel Z by Zing is the place for you. Not fancy but clean and the staff wonderful. The location is 1 Block from the beach and the Baht Bus that can take you to Jontiem Beach or into town for less than a cup of coffee. If you're looking for fancy hotel look elsewhere but I give it a 10 for cleanliness, convenience and quietness. The behaviour of staff was rude. A guy named Aon Chanamon behaved as if he was the king and we were his servants. On asking for cups for coffee, he started shouting at us and said that we can bring cups from our rooms if we need any coffee. Don't know how such poor hospitality gets such good reviews on Tripadvisor. I'm glad we only stay 4 hours at this budget hotel , due have to go back for work in BKK next day. room was okay for its price per night. 486 baht , small cockroaches we found but it's okay since we just stay for hours. but receptionist i can't miss to mentioned here. we kindly ask reception if we can have a new towel due the towel in the room we have used is dirty and not in good condition towels it's like a rag though, but 2 Guys and 1 lady receptionist insist that they will not change because we stay only 1 night, but i insist that will just stay for 4 hours besides the towel they provide is like a rag , so the woman (receptionist) says that she will going to change just for us in a very bad sarcastic way and bring to the room , but until we check out there's no towels deliver in the room. Three days at this hotel. Overall fine and nice experience. Very near to beach and public transport to other places is accessible. Pleasant and peaceful place with silence all over. Food restaurants are very near, you can roam around the beach even at nights Room very large and roomy clean and modern, staff friendly and welcoming few minutes walk from beach and restaurants. Approx 20min by car to central  Pattaya through traffic so a bit out of the way if you don't have transport. Would recommend hotel. The room is big enough, clean and tidy.    It's located about 500m from Jomtien Beach Road and is very quiet. Nothing close by to cause too much noise.    There is complimentary coffee in reception and tea (40 baht), not sure if you have to pay for the toast. It would be awesome if they could provide filter coffee.    This is a budget hotel and the location bears this out. There doesn't appear to be any rooms with a view. The reception front is opposite a car park. My room has the view of the side of another hotel. Not the type hotel where you can laze around if you didn't want to go sight-seeing. Staff of Z by Zing is topping the overall package. A clean, well maintained place. At the heart of Jomtien beach but laid back enough to avoid the noise of the beach road traffic. A good stay for a night or a couple of days at this destination. Not five star luxury - but always a five star smile! The staff couldn't have been more helpful and accommodating. A boutique hotel on a quiet street with 42 rooms. We had a deluxe room on the ground floor which was very comfortable for a Canadian senior couple. This is a 6 floor hotel with an elevator. Everything very clean...highly recommended. Beach, small stores and laundry within easy walk. Stayed one night only.  Pro:  - personnel was friendly and helpful indeed  - cleanness  - puple decor  - fast wifi    Contra:  - location (ok, but among incompleted constraction)  - room at ground floor was a bit dark. It is a very nice and comfortable hotel. Although, far from the main city center yet well connected with public transportation. The rooms are very comfortable and staffs are also nice. In hotel they take 500Bhat as a security money and it is returned during checkout time. Young staff, very nice people, great price, super clean room, excellent bed, small to medium size room. I'd say pretty also, but that's taste. Coffee available all the time. Guess it depends on what you like, so people who complain it's not near the crowded downtown glitzy part of Pattaya are right. But me and my lady friend (we're a 50's and 60's age group) just loved it. A five minute or less walk to very nice beach, quiet at the end of deserted street for us was fine. Wonderful inexpensive delicious restaurant right around the corner. Incredibly inexpensive, well run, not fancy, but what do you need for a romantic little vacation besides a beautiful beach with hawkers offering you fresh pineapple and mangoes every few minutes for a pittance, and a quiet safe room. And a great name to remember, Z by Zing, my friend and I laugh about it when we think of it! If you are on a budget then this is a great choice. 200m off the main beach road this is a cheap hotel. i got a big room on the second floor, comfortable bed, decent bathroom. Internet was included and I paid just 550bt. Beware though the stairs are steep inside, go in the lift!! We have booked for two rooms, double and triple occupancy. The hotel close with the beach, but we have to used tuk tuk to go to Pattaya City and Walking Street. In generally, the rooms very clean and enjoyed our stay here. But wifi not working enough, sometimes can be used, sometimes cannot connected. The hotel overall is very good & clean. We saw the rate at 8 so decided to stay into this hotel. But very disappointed at the location.It was far from the Pattaya city or walking street. When you need to walk back to your hotel, you need to walk through a short distance which would spent you about 2 mins from the main road. It was near to the under~construction property. The noise is very terrible and make us leave the room as soon as possible. writing the review a year later but per latest reviews, it still seems relavant.  stayed here in July 2015.    This is a very clean place. The rooms are clean, the bedding is good, the toilets and shower is good. Also it costs around 500THB that is super cool. Free wifi. No in-house kitchen.    This hotel is on the quieter Jomtien beach area and hence far from all actions.But you can always -any time- walk to the main road and take a shared tempo-songtaew- and reach anywhere in just 10THB per head.    Jomtien beach is just 2 mins walk...so you can take stroll or just sit on the beaches in the night.    Overall, a very good place to stay and well within budget. (but if your are a gang of boys willing to spend to stay closer to walking street...then dont choose jomtien beach area...or this hotel)    No views from your window unless you take the topmost floor. Stay here on my recent visit to pattaya, i found this property on booking.com on 8.0 rating, therefore i thought this would be a good choice, but it turn out to be the opposite for me.    Here's the pros of the hotel:  1. It's cheap, it cost much cheaper than any other hotel in pattaya.  2. It's clean, yes i say its clean. The rooms are well kept, no stains on bedsheets or toilets.  3. The Shower is good. The water rush on these showers are really good!  4. Wifi is super fast! I was happy with it!  5. This place is quite, away from the clubs and bars, at night it can be very deserted.    Here's the cons, as per my review. If you are a party goers, looking for entertainment then it's a big no for you! Here's why i said so:  1. The Location! It's way too far from the central pattaya or walking street! These part of pattaya (jomtien) is a bit laidback, thr's not much entertainment here and everytime you wnt to go to walking street 'sontheaw' ride cost between 150bt to 200bt. So you still lose the money you save on the hotel rate!  2. The surrounding is no good. This part of the town is on construction site, or these buildings are abandoned! So i can get abit frightening at night. But no problems, just that its on deserted place.  3. The rooms has rules, they will charge you not only for damage but also for dirty! Therefore if you stay here, then you got to be very very careful with their stuff.  4. Door has Gaps! Doors when closed has got gaps in between, if there's anyone whom tried to peep, i believe they can see!    I would not come here back, simply because of the location. Rather pay abit more and stay in places near central pattaya. One of the favourite hotel we stayed in Thailand. Lovely environment. The place is clean and beautiful. Nearby to Jomtien Beach, local restaurants and massage centers. Staffs speak English. It made easy to communicte with them. Worth an experience. Loved it! This place is a little off the beaten path which can be both good and bad. The bad is that you are away from all the 'action' in the Jomtien/Pattaya area which can be good on it's own, and the good part is that if you want a nice quiet place to be that is super reasonable then you have found it. It's about the equivalent of 2-3 blocks from the beach so it's just a short stroll to get there. Or take a passing songtow and head off to the Night Market or Rampoo market for some great street food for next to nothing. While the rooms can seem a little sparse from Western standards and there really isn't any view from the rooms, this isn't where I spent my waking hours. Good place to just come back to and get cleaned up so you can head back out and get some food (and maybe a beer). I really like this hotel the rooms are nice and clean. The staff are very friendly and speak good English. The hotel is close to the beach and local restaurants. The price is very good if you are looking for a budget hotel then check this place out. I was looking for a cheap place to spend one night before moving on from Jomtien Beach... This achieves that goal. The first thing you notice about the room is how big it is. It's massive. BUT with all this space there ia very little you can do with it, one small couch, a bed and a writers table try to soak up the vast space but fail. Its got a ""white"" theme going on with a ton of lights in the ceiling that amplify the rooms whiteness when turned on. Its just not my cup of tea. You wont get that romantic golden glow here. But the price is low, its clean and appears safe. Location is ok. = central Jomtien behind the main street. 1 minute walk to the beach. Z by Zing is hidden in the end of a blind ally with hostels and industry as neighbours. It's not a nice neighbourhood but it also means you are a distance from the noisy cars in the busy street.  My room was clean but very impersonal. Not a cosy room. The doors had really big openings around it and it was tried fixed with rubber bands but without mentionable success! I could look out into the hallway. Both light and noise came through easily at night.  Staff was polite and helpful. But the shower was fantastic! Loads of water and as hot as you wanted it from the large shower head.  The beach is not very far away but I never went to stay there.  Along the busy street there are lots of sale booths. Everything from fresh fruit, street food, travel agencies and various souvenirs. From the Zing family.  I stayed in 3 hotels of their chain, this one was the one I liked the least, but still good for what you paid.    Welcome at the reception was cold, room was nice and bright.  Some details however could easily be ameliorated though (coffee bags in room were forgotten, coffee cups still dirty).  Location nog far from the bracht but the other Zing-hotel in Pattaya is beter located in my opinion.    All in all very decent for what you pay. The hotel is nice and comfortable. Near to jomtien beach but not so near to central Pattaya. It has all the basic amenities like wifi, t.v., fridge etc. Overall, a good stay and can be recommended to other guests who wish to stay at a quieter place. We were really pleasantly surprised when we arrived at this hotel. We booked a superior double room for two weeks over Christmas & new year, and could happily have stayed longer. The location is perfect; right near the beach and still set back from the noise of the main road. 10 baht buses will run you anywhere in the area from this main road. Everything in the room worked and nothing leaked, which was a real difference from the other places we've stayed in Thailand. Inside the room was spotless, but the balcony was constantly grubby. It was quiet at night, but we were woken early most mornings by the building work next door, which we disappointingly hadn't been forewarned about. Building started around 7:30am most mornings and was hard to sleep through in our room, but maybe some rooms are quieter than others. They sell tea, coffee and toast in the foyer, and there is a 30 baht washing machine right outside the hotel if their laundry prices are a little pricey for you (like they were for us). The staff were not that brilliant, but not in any way rude; I think they were maybe just shy as their English was a little limited. Everyone apart from the manager just seemed to ignore us completely, unless we approached them first. Aircon and WiFi worked well. The bed was hard but no worse than the rest of Thailand. I highly recommend this hotel! The room is clean.. New hotel, so the property is great. It has a refrigerator in the room. Nice staff, i got so many helps of the direction from them..  But the lift only take to 5th floor.. I got the 6th floor, so i have to take a stair.  Over all, it was so great place to take a rest.. Basic budget hotel. Rooms are undoubtedly big and everything else is very basic.Can't expect much with such pricing. The hotel however expect a deposit of 1000 bath upon check in.    Room: The room does have a safe but the size is about 6 X 4 inches so it is not very useful. The room doors are still using the conventional type of locking system so it is rather easy to prise open which made me feel rather insecure. There were on going construction work going on outside so by 9am I was totally awake by the natural alarm clock.    Staff: The staff, they are not very well versed in almost everything because whatever I ask I only got a yes, no or I don't know answer.    Location: The hotel location is really hard to find even for the locals so had to use another hotel as a landmark for cabs. The vicinity of the hotel don't really serve much food however if anyone is willing to walk about 500m there are some food stalls outside.    Wifi: the hotel provide encrypted wifi and the stability was ok.    Conclusion: This hotel has nothing to shout about but well for a budget hotel I guess it'll suffice. I am Thai tourist. This is my first time travelling in Pattaya alone. Z by Zing is so great about the price, cleanliness, service-minded staff. I paid around 480 baht per night through Expedia which it really worth staying here. I am so impressed about the super clean new room with the fridge. You can walk to the Jom-tien beach in 5 minutes. You can also find laudromat near there. At first, I planned to stay for a night but I extended to 3 nights. Thank you for good stay ^^ great hotel,pro staff,very helpful.clean rooms,great location 100 meters from the beach.a bit out of nightlife and bars but if you want to sleep at night it is perfect.good for long term,business travelers or couples.
